         "JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\" § 2255, P6(1). This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation. It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become \"final\" for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?\n\nIn accord with this Court's consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate  court mandate as the triggering date. For the purpose of starting the clock  on § 2255's one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court's affirmation of the conviction.\n\nI\n\nIn 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions. That court's mandate issued on December 15, 1998. See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals' mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment). Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari. The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals' judgment, see this Court's Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate court's mandate.\n\n On February 22, 2000 -- one year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expired -- Clay filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Congress has prescribed \"[a] 1-year period of limitation\" for such motions \"running from the latest of\" four specified dates. § 2255, P6. Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, as in the generality of cases, is the first: \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\" § 2255, P6(1).\n\nRelying on Gendron v. United States, 154 F.3d 672, 674 (CA7 1998)(per curiam), the District Court stated that \"when a federal prisoner in this circuit does not seek certiorari . . ., the conviction becomes 'final' on the date the appellate court issues the mandate in the direct appeal.\" App. to Pet. for Cert.  8a. Because Clay filed his § 2255 motion  more than one year after that date, the court denied the motion as time barred.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit affirmed. That court declined Clay's \"invitation to reconsider our holding in Gendron,\" although it acknowledged that Gendron's \"construction of section 2255 represents the minority view.\" 30 Fed. Appx. 607, 609 (2002). \"Bowing to stare decisis,\" the court expressed \"reluctance to overrule [its own] recently-reaffirmed precedent without guidance from the Supreme Court.\" Ibid.\n\n The Fourth Circuit has agreed with Gendron's interpretation of § 2255. See United States v. Torres, 211 F.3d 836, 838-842 (2000) (when a federal prisoner does not  file a petition for certiorari, his judgment of conviction becomes final for § 2255 purposes upon issuance of the court of appeals' mandate). Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways with the Seventh and Fourth Circuits. These courts hold that, for federal prisoners like Clay who do not file petitions for certiorari following affirmance of their convictions, § 2255's one-year limitation period begins to run when the defendant's time for seeking review by this Court expires. 1See Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 39-42 (CA1 2002); Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d 565, 567-577 (CA3 1999); United States v. Gamble, 208 F.3d 536, 537 (CA5 2000)(per curiam); United States v. Garcia, 210 F.3d 1058, 1059-1061 (CA9 2000); United States v. Burch, 202 F.3d 1274, 1275-1279 (CA10 2000); Kaufmann v. United States, 282 F.3d 1336, 1337-1339 (CA11 2002). To  secure uniformity in the application of § 2255's time constraint, we granted certiorari, 536 U.S. 957, 153 L. Ed. 2d 834, 122 S. Ct. 2658 (2002), and now reverse the Seventh Circuit's judgment. 2Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts of appeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitioner Clay in urging that Clay's § 2255 motion was timely filed. We therefore invited David W. DeBruin to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuit's judgment. Mr. DeBruin's able advocacy permits us to decide the case satisfied that the relevant issues have been fully aired.\n\nIIFinality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context. Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment. See, e.g., Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,517 U.S. 706, 712, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1, 116 S. Ct. 1712 (1996); Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 13, Comment b (1980). For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage. For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. § 3161 et seq., and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate court's mandate. See Brief for Amicus Curiae by Invitation of the Court 22-28 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases). For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, \"the time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).\" This Court's Rule 13(3).\n\nHere, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires. See, e.g., Caspari v. Bohlen,510 U.S. 383, 390, 127 L. Ed. 2d 236, 114 S. Ct. 948 (1994);Griffith v. Kentucky,479 U.S. 314, 321, n. 6, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649, 107 S. Ct. 708 (1987);Barefoot v. Estelle,463 U.S. 880, 887, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1090, 103 S. Ct. 3383 (1983);United States v. Johnson,457 U.S. 537, 542, n. 8, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202, 102 S. Ct. 2579 (1982);Linkletter v. Walker,381 U.S. 618, 622, n. 5, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601, 85 S. Ct. 1731 (1965). Because \"we presume that Congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with this Court's precedents,\" United States v. Wells,519 U.S. 482, 495, 137 L. Ed. 2d 107, 117 S. Ct. 921 (1997), our unvarying understanding  of finality for collateral review purposes would ordinarily determine the meaning of \"becomes final\" in § 2255.Amicus urges a different determinant, relying on verbal differences between § 2255 and a parallel statutory provision, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), which governs petitions for federal habeas corpus by state prisoners. See  DeBruin Brief 8-20. Sections 2255 and 2244(d)(1), as now formulated, were reshaped by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. See §§ 101, 105, 110 Stat. 1217, 1220. Prior to that Act, no statute of limitations governed requests for federal habeas corpus or § 2255 habeas-like relief. See Vasquez v. Hillery,474 U.S. 254, 265, 88 L. Ed. 2d 598, 106 S. Ct. 617 (1986); United States v. Nahodil, 36 F.3d 323, 328 (CA3 1994). Like § 2255, § 2244(d)(1) establishes a one-year limitation period, running from the latest of four specified dates. Three of the four time triggers under § 2244(d)(1) closely track corresponding portions of § 2255. Compare §§ 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D), with § 2255, PP6(2)-(4). But where § 2255, P6(1), refers simply to \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final,\" § 2244(d)(1)(A) speaks of \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" 3The Courts of Appeals have uniformly interpreted \"direct review\" in § 2244(d)(1)(A) to encompass review of a state conviction by this Court. See Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d at 40-41; Williams v. Artuz, 237 F.3d 147, 151 (CA2 2001); Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d at 575; Hill v. Braxton, 277 F.3d 701, 704 (CA4 2002); Ott v. Johnson, 192 F.3d 510, 513 (CA5 1999); Bronaugh v. Ohio, 235 F.3d 280, 283 (CA6 2000); Anderson v. Litscher, 281 F.3d 672, 674-675 (CA7 2002); Smith v. Bowersox, 159 F.3d 345, 347-348 (CA8 1998); Bowen v. Roe, 188 F.3d 1157, 1159 (CA9 1999); Locke v. Saffle, 237 F.3d 1269, 1273 (CA10 2001); Bond v. Moore, 309 F.3d 770, 774 (CA11 2002).\n\nWhen \"Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act,\" we have recognized, \"it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" Russello v. United States,464 U.S. 16, 23, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17, 104 S. Ct. 296 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972)). Invoking the maxim recited in Russello, amicus asserts that \"becomes final\" in § 2255, P6(1), cannot mean the same thing as \"became final\" in § 2244(d)(1)(A); reading the two as synonymous, amicus maintains, would render superfluous the words \"by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\" -- words found only in the latter provision. DeBruin Brief 8-20. We can give effect to the discrete wording of the two prescriptions, amicus urges, if we adopt the following rule: When a convicted defendant does not seek certiorari on direct review, § 2255's limitation period starts to run on the date the court of appeals issues its mandate. Id., at 36. 4Although recognizing that \"the question is not presented in this case,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, amicus suggests that § 2255's limitation period starts to run upon issuance of the court of appeals' mandate even in cases in which the defendant does petition for certiorari. Id., at 27-28, 36-38, 41-42. As amicus also recognizes, however, id., at 41, courts of appeals \"have uniformly concluded that, if a prisoner petitions for certiorari, the contested conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either denies the writ or issues a decision on the merits,\" United States v. Hicks, 350 U.S. App. D.C. 279, 283 F.3d 380, 387 (CADC 2002).\n\nAmicus would have a stronger argument if § 2255, P6(1), explicitly incorporated the first of § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s finality formulations but not the second, so that the § 2255 text read \"becomes final by the conclusion of direct review.\" Had § 2255 explicitly provided for the first of the two finality triggers set forth in § 2244(d)(1)(A), one might indeed question the soundness of interpreting § 2255 implicitly to incorporate § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s second trigger as well. As written, however, § 2255 does not qualify \"becomes final\" at all. Using neither of the disjunctive phrases that follow the words \"became final\" in § 2244(d)(1)(A), § 2255 simply leaves \"becomes final\" undefined.\n\nRussello, we think it plain, hardly warrants the decision amicus urges, one that  would hold the § 2255 petitioner to  a tighter time constraint than the petitioner governed by § 2244(d)(1)(A). Russello concerned the meaning of a provision in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., that directed forfeiture to the United States of \"any interest [a convicted defendant] has acquired . . . in violation of [the Act].\" § 1963(a)(1). The petitioner in Russello urged a narrow construction of the unqualified words \"any interest . . . acquired.\" Rejecting that argument, we observed that a succeeding subsection, § 1963(a)(2), reached \"any interest in . . . any enterprise\" the defendant conducted in violation of RICO's proscriptions. At that point, we referred to the maxim invoked by amicus. See supra, at 6. The qualifying words \"in . . . any enterprise\" narrowed § 1963(a)(2), but in no way affected § 1963(a)(1). The comparison of the two subsections, we said, \"fortified\" the broad construction we approved for the unmodified words \"any interest . . . acquired.\" Russello, 464 U.S., at 22-23 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 23 (\"Had Congress intended to restrict § 1963(a)(1) to an interest in an enterprise, it presumably would have done so expressly as it did in the immediately following subsection (a)(2).\").\n\nFar from supporting the Seventh Circuit's constricted reading of § 2255, P6(1), Russello's reasoning tends in Clay's favor. An unqualified term -- here \"becomes final\" -- Russello indicates, calls for a reading surely no less broad than a pinpointed one -- here, § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s specification \"became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\"\n\nMoreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief for Petitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 7-8, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of \"final\" in § 2244(d)(1)(A) but not in § 2255. Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners. In that context, a bare reference to \"became final\" might have suggested that finality assessments  should be made by reference to state law rules that may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State. Cf.  Artuz v. Bennett,531 U.S. 4, 8, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361 (2000) (an application for state postconviction relief is \"properly filed\" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) \"when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable [state] laws and rules governing filings\"). The words \"by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\" make it clear that finality for the purpose of § 2244(d)(1)(A) is to be determined by reference to a uniform federal rule. Section 2255, however, governs only petitions by federal prisoners; within the federal  system there is no comparable risk of varying rules to guard against.\n\nAmicus also submits that 28 U.S.C. § 2263 \"reinforces\" the Seventh Circuit's understanding of § 2255. DeBruin Brief 20; accord, Torres, 211 F.3d at 840. Chapter 154 of Title 28 governs certain habeas petitions filed by death-sentenced state prisoners. Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from \"final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" That period is tolled, however, \"from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review.\" § 2263(b)(1).\n\nWe do not find in § 2263 cause to alter our reading of § 2255. First, amicus' reliance on § 2263 encounters essentially the same problem as does his reliance on § 2244(d)(1)(A): Section 2255, P6(1), refers to neither of the two events that § 2263(a) identifies as possible starting points for the limitation period -- \"affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review\" and \"the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" Thus, reasoning by negative implication from § 2263 does not justify the conclusion that § 2255, P6(1)'s limitation period begins to run at one of those times rather than the other. Cf. supra, at 6-8. Second, § 2263(a) ties the applicable limitation period to \"affirmance of the conviction and sentence,\" while § 2255, P6(1), ties the limitation period to the date when \"the judgment of conviction becomes final.\" See Torres, 211 F.3d at 845 (Hamilton, J., dissenting). \"The Russello presumption -- that the presence of a phrase in one provision and its absence in another reveals Congress' design -- grows weaker with each difference in the formulation of the provisions under inspection.\" Columbus v. Ours Garage & Wrecker Service, Inc.,536 U.S. 424, 435-436, 153 L. Ed. 2d 430, 122 S. Ct. 2226 (2002).\n\n* * *\n\nWe hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, § 2255's one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires. Under this rule, Clay's § 2255 petition was timely filed. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nIt is so ordered.  \n\n"

         "Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\nIn most of the United States, not including California, the minimum price paid to dairy farmers producing raw milk is regulated pursuant to federal marketing orders.  Those orders guarantee a uniform price for the producers, but through pooling mechanisms require the processors of different classes of dairy products to pay different prices.  Thus, for example, processors of fluid milk pay a premium price, part of which goes into an equalization pool that provides a partial subsidy for cheese manufacturers who pay a net price that is lower than the farmers receive.  SeeWest Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,512 U.S. 186, 189, n. 1, 129 L. Ed. 2d 157, 114 S. Ct. 2205 (1994). \n\n The California Legislature  has adopted a similar program to regulate the minimum prices paid by California processors to California producers. In the cases before us today, out-of-state producers are challenging the constitutionality of a 1997 amendment to that program.  They present us with two questions: (1) whether § 144 of the Federal Agriculture  Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, 110 Stat 917, 7 USC § 7254 [7 USCS § 7254], exempts California's milk pricing and pooling regulations from scrutiny under the Commerce Clause; and (2) whether the individual petitioners' claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause is foreclosed because  those regulations do not discriminate on their face on the basis of state citizenship or state residence. \n\nI \n\nGovernment regulation of the marketing of raw milk has been continuous since the Great Depression. 1The history and purpose of federal regulation of milk marketing is described in some detail inZuber v. Allen,396 U.S. 168, 172-187, 24 L. Ed. 2d 345, 90 S. Ct. 314 (1969). In California, three related statutes establish the regulatory structure for milk produced, processed, or sold in California.  First, in 1935, the State enacted the Milk Stabilization and Marketing Act, Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. §§ 61801-62403 (West 2001), \"to establish minimum producer prices at fair and reasonable levels so as to generate reasonable producer incomes that will promote the intelligent and orderly marketing of market milk . . .\" § 61802(h).  Then, California created requirements for composition of milk products in the Milk and Milk Products Act of 1947. §§ 32501-39912.  The standards created under this Act mandate minimum percentages of fat and solids-not-fat in dairy products and often require fortification of milk by adding solids-not-fat. In 1967, California passed another milk pricing act, the Gonsalves Milk Pooling Act, §§ 62700-62731, to address deficiencies in the existing pricing scheme.  Together, these three Acts (including numerous subsequent revisions) create the state milk marketing structure: The 1935 and 1967 Acts establish the milk pricing and pooling plans, while the 1947 Act governs the composition of milk products sold in California. \n\nWhile it serves the same purposes as the federal marketing orders, California's regulatory program is more complex.   Federal orders typically guarantee all producers the same minimum price and create only two or three classes of end uses to determine the processors' contributions to, or withdrawals from, the equalization pools, whereas under the California scheme some of the farmers' production commands a \"quota price\" and some receives a lower \"overbase price,\" and the processors' end uses of the milk are divided into five different classes. \n\nThe complexities of the California scheme are not relevant to these cases; what is relevant is the fact California processors of fluid milk pay a premium price (part of which goes into a pool) that is higher than either of the prices paid to the producers. 2Because processors of fluid milk typically manufacture some other products as well, their respective pool contributions reflect the relative amounts of those end uses.  Each processor's mix of end uses produces an individual monthly \"blend price\" that is multiplied by its total purchases.  Under federal orders the term \"blend price\" has a different meaning; it usually refers to the price that the producer receives.  SeeWest Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,512 U.S. 186, 189, n. 1, 129 L. Ed. 2d 157, 114 S. Ct. 2205 (1994). During the early 1990's,  market conditions made it profitable for some California processors to buy raw milk from out-of-state producers at prices that were higher than either the quota prices or the overbase prices guaranteed to California farmers yet lower than the premium prices they had to pay when making in-state purchases.  The regulatory scheme was at least partially responsible for the advantage enjoyed by out-of-state producers because it did not require the processors to make any contribution to the equalization pool on such purchases.  In other words, whereas an in-state purchase of raw milk resold as fluid milk required the processor both to pay a guaranteed minimum to the farmer and also to make a contribution to the pool, an out-of-state purchase at a higher price would often be cheaper because it required no pool contribution. \n\n In 1997, the California Department of Food and Agriculture amended its plan to require that contributions to the  pool be made on some out-of-state purchases. 3After the 1997 amendment, processors whose blend price exceeds the quota price must make contributions to the pool on their out-of-state purchases as well as their in-state purchases. It is the imposition of that requirement that gave rise to this litigation.  Petitioners in No. 01-950 operate dairy farms in Nevada; petitioners in No. 01-1018 operate such farms in Arizona.  They contend that the 1997 amendment discriminates against them.  In response, the California officials contend that it merely eliminated an unfair competitive advantage for out-of-state producers that was the product of the regulatory scheme itself. \n\nWithout reaching the merits of petitioners' constitutional claims, the District Court dismissed both cases and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 259 F.3d 1148 (2001).  Relying on its earlier decision inShamrock Farms Co. v. Veneman, 146 F.3d 1177 (1998), the court held that a federal statute enacted in 1996 had immunized California's milk pricing and pooling laws from Commerce Clause challenge.  It also held that the corporate petitioners had no standing to raise a claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and that the individuals' claim under that Clause failed because the 1997 plan amendments did not \"on their face, create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenship.\" 259 F.3d at 1156.  We granted certiorari to review those two holdings,537 U.S. 522, 537 U.S. 1099, 154 L. Ed. 2d 766, 123 S. Ct. 818 (2003), but in doing so we do not reach the merits of either constitutional claim. \n\nII \n\nIn some respects, the State's composition standards set forth in the 1947 Act exceed those set by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  For example, California's minimum standard for reduced fat milk requires that it contain at least 10 percent solids-not-fat (which include protein,  calcium, lactose and other nutrients).  Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. § 38211 (West 2001).  Federal standards require that reduced fat milk contain only 8.25 percent solids-not-fat.  See 21 CFR §§ 131.110, 101.62 (2002).  Some of California's standards were arguably pre-empted by Congress' enactment of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA), 104 Stat 2353, which contains a prohibition against the application of state quality standards to foods moving in interstate commerce. See 21 U.S.C. § 343-1(a) [21 USCS § 343-1(a)]. The District Court so held in Shamrock Farms Co. v Veneman, No. Civ-S-95-318 (ED Cal 1996).  In response to that decision, California sought an exemption from both the FDA and Congress.  SeeShamrock Farms, 146 F.3d at 1180.  Before the FDA acted, Congress responded favorably with the enactment of the statute that governs our disposition of these cases.  That statute, § 144 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, provides: \"Nothing in this Act or any other provision of law shall be construed to preempt, prohibit, or otherwise limit the authority of the State of California, directly or indirectly, to establish or continue to effect any law, regulation, or requirement regarding-- \"(1) the percentage of milk solids or solids not fat in fluid milk products sold at retail or marketed in the State of California; or \"(2) the labeling of such fluid milk products with regard to milk solids or solids not fat.\" 7 USC § 7254 [7 USCS § 7254].\n\nThereafter, Shamrock Farms brought another suit against the Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture challenging the validity of both the State's compositional standards and its milk pricing and pooling laws.  In that case, the Court of Appeals held that § 144 had immunized California's marketing programs as well as the compositional standards from a negative Commerce Clause challenge. Shamrock Farms,146 F.3d at 1182.  In adhering to that ruling in the cases before us today, the Ninth Circuit erred. \n\n The text of the federal statute plainly covers California laws regulating the composition and labeling of fluid milk products, but does not mention laws regulating pricing. Congress certainly has the power to authorize state regulations that burden or discriminate against interstate commerce,Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin,328 U.S. 408, 90 L. Ed. 1342, 66 S. Ct. 1142 (1946), but we will not assume that it has done so unless such an intent is clearly expressed. South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke,467 U.S. 82, 91-92, 81 L. Ed. 2d 71, 104 S. Ct. 2237 (1984).While § 144 unambiguously expresses such an intent with respect to California's compositional and labeling laws, that expression does not encompass the pricing and pooling laws.  This conclusion is buttressed by the separate California statutes addressing the composition and labeling of milk products, on the one hand, and the pricing and pooling of milk on the other.  See supra, at 539 U.S. 59, 156 L. Ed. 2d 54, 59-60, 123 S. Ct. 2142 (2003).  The mere fact that the composition and labeling laws relate to the sale of fluid milk is by no means sufficient to bring them within the scope of § 144.  Because § 144 does not clearly express an intent to insulate California's pricing and pooling laws from a Commerce Clause challenge, the Court of Appeals erred in relying on § 144 to dismiss the challenge. \n\n III \n\n Article IV, § 2, of the Constitution provides: \"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\"\n\nPetitioners, who include both individual dairy farmers and corporate dairies, have alleged that California's milk pricing laws violate that provision.  The Court of Appeals held that the corporate petitioners have no standing to advance such  a claim, and it rejected the individual petitioners' claims because the California laws \"do not, on their face, create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenship.\" 259 F.3d at 1156.  Petitioners do not challenge the first holding, but they contend that the second is inconsistent with our decision inChalker v. Birmingham & Northwestern R. Co.,249 U.S. 522, 63 L. Ed. 748, 39 S. Ct. 366 (1919).  We agree. \n\nIn Chalker, we held that a Tennessee tax imposed on a citizen and resident of Alabama for engaging in the business of constructing a railroad in Tennessee violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The tax did not on its face draw any distinction based on citizenship or residence.  It did, however, impose a higher rate on persons who had their principal offices out of State.  Taking judicial notice of the fact that \"the chief office of an individual is commonly in the State of which he is a citizen,\" we concluded that the practical effect of the provision was discriminatory. Id., at 527, 63 L Ed 748, 39 S Ct 366.  Whether Chalker should be interpreted as merely applying the Clause to classifications that are but proxies for differential treatment against out-of-state residents, or as prohibiting any classification with the practical effect of discriminating against such residents, is a matter we need not decide at this stage of the case.  Under either interpretation, we agree with petitioners that the absence of an express statement in the California laws and regulations identifying out-of-state citizenship as a basis for disparate treatment is not a sufficient basis for rejecting this claim.  In so holding, however, we express no opinion on the merits of petitioners' Privileges and Immunities Clause claim. * * * \n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and these cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n\nIt is so ordered.  \n\n"

         "Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n We confront here the problem of a \"mixed\" petition for habeas corpus relief in which a state prisoner presents a federal court with a single petition containing some claims that have been exhausted in the state courts and some that have not.  More precisely, we consider whether a federal district court has discretion to stay the mixed petition to allow the petitioner to present his unexhausted claims to the state  court in the first instance, and then to return to federal court for review of his perfected petition. \n\n I \n\nPetitioner Charles Russell Rhines was convicted in South Dakota state court of first-degree murder and third-degree burglary and sentenced to death.  His conviction became final on December 2, 1996, when we denied his initial petition for certiorari.  Rhines v. South Dakota, 519 U.S. 1013, 136 L. Ed. 2d 410, 117 S. Ct. 522.  On December 5, 1996, Rhines filed a petition for state habeas corpus.  App. 32.  The state court denied his petition, and the Supreme Court of South Dakota affirmed on February 9, 2000, Rhines v. Weber, 2000 SD 19, 608 N.W.2d 303.Rhines filed his pro se petition for federal habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254] in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota on February 22, 2000.  App 3.  Because the 1-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) was tolled while Rhines' state habeas corpus petition was pending, see 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2244(d)(2)], he still had more than 11 months left before the expiration of the limitations period. \n\nWith the assistance of court-appointed counsel, Rhines filed an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus and statement of exhaustion on November 20, 2000, asserting 35 claims of constitutional defects in his conviction and sentence.  App. 39-60.  The State challenged 12 of those claims as unexhausted. Id., at 72-79.  On July 3, 2002, approximately 18 months after Rhines had filed his amended federal habeas corpus petition, the District Court held that 8 of the 35 claims had not been exhausted. At this time, the AEDPA 1-year statute of limitations had run.  See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 181-182, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (2001) (holding that the statute of limitations is not tolled during the pendancy of a federal petition).  As a result, if the District Court had dismissed Rhines' mixed petition at that point, he would  have been unable to refile in federal court after exhausting the unexhausted claims.   Rhines therefore moved the District Court to hold his pending habeas petition in abeyance while he presented his unexhausted claims to the South Dakota courts.  On July 3, 2002, the District Court granted the motion and issued a stay \"conditioned upon petitioner commencing state court exhaustion proceedings within sixty days of this order and returning to this court within sixty days of completing such exhaustion.\" App. 136.  In compliance with that order, Rhines filed his second state habeas corpus petition on August 22, 2003. \n\nThe State appealed the District Court's stay of Rhines' mixed petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  Relying on its decision in Akins v. Kenney, 341 F.3d 681, 686 (2003) (holding that \"a district court has no authority to hold a habeas petition containing unexhausted claims in abeyance absent truly exceptional circumstances\" (internal quotation marks omitted)), the Court of Appeals vacated the stay and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Rhines could proceed by deleting unexhausted claims from his petition.  346 F.3d 799 (2003).  We granted certiorari to resolve a split in the Circuits regarding the propriety of the District Court's \"stay-and-abeyance\" procedure.  542 U.S. 936, 159 L. Ed. 2d 811, 124 S. Ct. 2905 (2004).  Compare, e.g., Crews v. Horn, 360 F.3d 146, 152 (CA3 2004); and Zarvela v. Artuz, 254 F.3d 374, 381 (CA2 2001), with 346 F.3d 799 (2003) (case below). \n\nII \n\n Fourteen years before Congress enacted AEDPA, we held in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (1982), that federal district courts may not adjudicate mixed petitions for habeas corpus, that is, petitions containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims.  We reasoned that the interests of comity and federalism dictate that state courts must have the first opportunity to decide a petitioner's claims. Id., at 518-519, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.  We  noted that \"[b]ecause 'it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation,' federal courts apply the doctrine of comity.\" Id., at 518, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (quoting Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204, 94 L. Ed. 761, 70 S. Ct. 587 (1950)).  That doctrine \"'teaches that one court should defer action on causes properly within its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty with concurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation, have had an opportunity to pass upon the matter.'\" 455 U.S., at 518, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198. \n\n Accordingly, we imposed a requirement of \"total exhaustion\" and directed federal courts to effectuate that requirement by dismissing mixed petitions without prejudice and allowing petitioners to return to state court to present the unexhausted claims to that court in the first instance. Id., at 522, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.  When we decided Lundy, there was no statute of limitations on the filing of federal habeas corpus petitions.  As a result, petitioners who returned to state court to exhaust their previously unexhausted claims could come back to federal court to present their perfected petitions with relative ease.   See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 486, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542, 120 S. Ct. 1595 (2000) (dismissal without prejudice under Lundy \"contemplated that the prisoner could return to federal court after the requisite exhaustion\"). \n\n The enactment of AEDPA in 1996 dramatically altered the landscape for federal habeas corpus petitions.  AEDPA preserved Lundy's total exhaustion requirement, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(1)(A)] (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted unless it appears that . . . the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State\"), but it also imposed a 1-year statute of limitations on the filing of federal petitions, § 2244(d).  Although the limitations period is tolled during the pendency of a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review,\" § 2244(d)(2), the filing of a petition for habeas  corpus in federal court does not toll the statute of limitations,  Duncan, 533 U.S. at 181-182, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120. \n\n As a result of the interplay between AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations and Lundy's dismissal requirement, petitioners who come to federal court with \"mixed\" petitions run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims.  If a petitioner files a timely but mixed petition in federal district court, and the district court dismisses it under Lundy after the limitations period has expired, this will likely mean the termination of any federal review.  For example, if the District Court in this case had dismissed the petition because it contained unexhausted claims, AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations would have barred Rhines from returning to federal court after exhausting the previously unexhausted claims in state court.  Similarly, if a district court dismisses a mixed petition close to the end of the 1-year period, the petitioner's chances of exhausting his claims in state court and refiling his petition in federal court before the limitations period runs are slim.  The problem is not limited to petitioners who file close to the AEDPA deadline.  Even a petitioner who files early will have no way of controlling when the district court will resolve the  question of exhaustion. Thus, whether a petitioner ever receives federal review of his claims may turn on which district court happens to hear his case. \n\n We recognize the gravity of this problem and the difficulty it has posed for petitioners and federal district courts alike.  In an attempt to solve the problem, some district courts have adopted a version of the \"stay-and-abeyance\" procedure employed by the District Court below.  Under this procedure, rather than dismiss the mixed petition pursuant to Lundy, a district court might stay the petition and hold it in abeyance while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his previously unexhausted claims.  Once the petitioner exhausts  his state remedies, the district court will lift the stay and allow the petitioner to proceed in federal court. \n\nDistrict courts do ordinarily have authority to issue stays, see Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254, 81 L. Ed. 153, 57 S. Ct. 163 (1936), where such a stay would be a proper exercise of discretion, see Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706, 137 L. Ed. 2d 945, 117 S. Ct. 1636 (1997).  AEDPA does not deprive district  courts of that authority, cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(1)(A)] (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted unless it appears that . . . the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State\" (emphasis added)), but it does circumscribe their discretion.  Any solution to this problem must therefore be compatible with AEDPA's purposes. \n\n One of the statute's purposes is to \"reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital cases.\" Woodford v. Garceau,538 U.S. 202, 206, 155 L. Ed. 2d 363, 123 S. Ct. 1398 (2003).  See also Duncan, 533 U.S., at 179, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120.  AEDPA's 1-year limitations period \"quite plainly serves the well-recognized interest in the finality of state court judgments.\" Ibid. It \"reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time that a prospective federal habeas petitioner has in which to seek federal habeas review.\" Ibid.\n\n Moreover, Congress enacted AEDPA against the backdrop of Lundy's total exhaustion requirement. The tolling provision in § 2244(d)(2) \"balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period,\" \"by protecting a state prisoner's ability later to apply for federal habeas relief while state remedies are being pursued.\" Duncan, supra, at 179, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120.  AEDPA thus encourages petitioners to seek relief from state courts in the first instance by tolling the 1-year limitations period while a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\" is pending.  28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2244(d)(2)].  This scheme reinforces the importance of Lundy's \"simple and clear instruction to potential litigants: before you bring any claims to federal court,  be sure that you first have taken each one to state court.\" 455 U.S., at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198. \n\n Stay and abeyance, if employed too frequently, has the potential to undermine these twin purposes.  Staying a federal habeas petition frustrates AEDPA's objective of encouraging finality by allowing a petitioner to delay the resolution of the federal proceedings.  It also undermines AEDPA's goal of streamlining federal habeas proceedings by decreasing a petitioner's incentive to exhaust all his claims in state court prior to filing his federal petition.  Cf. Duncan, supra, 533 U.S., at 180, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (\"[D]iminution of statutory incentives to proceed first in state court would . . . increase the risk of the very piecemeal litigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed to reduce\"). \n\n For these reasons, stay and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances.  Because granting a stay effectively excuses a petitioner's failure to present his claims first to the state courts, stay and abeyance is only appropriate when the district court determines there was good cause for the petitioner's failure to exhaust his claims first in state court.  Moreover, even if a petitioner had good cause for that failure, the district court would abuse its discretion if it were to grant him a stay when his unexhausted claims are plainly meritless.  Cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(2)] (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the  failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State\"). \n\nEven where stay and abeyance is appropriate, the district court's discretion in structuring the stay is limited by the timeliness concerns reflected in AEDPA.  A mixed petition should not be stayed indefinitely.  Though, generally, a prisoner's \"principal interest . . . is in obtaining speedy federal relief on his claims,\" Lundy, supra, at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion), not all petitioners have an incentive to obtain federal relief as quickly as possible.  In particular, capital petitioners might deliberately engage in dilatory tactics to prolong their  incarceration and avoid execution of the sentence of death.  Without time limits, petitioners could frustrate AEDPA's goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.  Thus, district courts should place reasonable time limits on a petitioner's trip to state court and back.  See, e.g., Zarvela, 254 F.3d, at 381 (\"[District courts] should explicitly condition the stay on the prisoner's pursuing state court remedies within a brief interval, normally 30 days, after the stay is entered and returning to federal court within a similarly brief interval, normally 30 days after state court exhaustion is completed\").  And if a petitioner engages in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay, the district court should not grant him a stay at all.  See id., at 380-381. \n\n On the other hand, it likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and to dismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed petition.  See Lundy, 455 U.S., at 522, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (the total exhaustion requirement was not intended to \"unreasonably impair the prisoner's right to relief\").  In such a case, the petitioner's interest in obtaining federal review of his claims outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of federal petitions.  For the same reason, if a petitioner presents a district court with a mixed petition and the court determines that stay and abeyance is inappropriate, the court should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims if dismissal of the entire petition would unreasonably impair the petitioner's right to obtain federal relief.  See id., at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion) (\"[A petitioner] can always amend the petition to delete the unexhausted claims, rather than returning to state court to exhaust all of his claims\"). \n\n The Court of Appeals erred to the extent it concluded that stay and abeyance is always impermissible.  We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for that court to determine, consistent with this opinion,  whether the District Court's grant of a stay in this case constituted an abuse of discretion. \n\nIt is so ordered. \n\n"

         "Justice Kennedy, Circuit Justice. \n\n This is an application for a stay of orders of the Seventh Judicial Circuit Court of St. Johns County, Florida.  The applicant, First Coast News, alleges the orders restrict its publication of the contents of transcripts of grand jury proceedings held in a criminal prosecution for murder.  First Coast News is a local television network that has been covering the prosecution.  For reasons to be discussed, the application is denied. \n\nI \n\nTwo orders are at issue.  The first was entered July 30, 2004.  It states the court had discovered that copies of the transcript of certain testimony before the grand jury had been released to members of the press as well as to investigators from the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office, in apparent violation of Fla. Stat.  § 905.27 (2003).  Section 905.27 generally prohibits the disclosure of grand jury testimony, with certain exceptions.  As relevant here, the order directs that \"[n]o party shall further disclose the contents of the transcript of testimony before the Grand Jury to any person not authorized by F. S. 905.27(2).\" Order Sealing Transcript, etc., in No. 04001748 CF (Fla Cir Ct, July 30, 2004), p 2, App. in Support of Stay Application, Tab 5 (hereinafter July 30 Order).  It further provides that \"[a]ll persons who have  obtained a copy of the transcript are placed on notice that any broadcast, publication, disclosure or communication of the contents of this transcript is a violation of F. S. 905.27, punishable as a misdemeanor in addition to constituting grounds for Criminal Contempt of Court.\" Ibid. Applicant alleges it received a copy of this order from the court.  See Application to Stay Prior Restraint Order 3. \n\nApplicant moved to intervene and set aside the July 30 Order as an unconstitutional prior restraint. This appears to have prompted the trial court to enter a second order.   The order, entered August 9, 2004, notes that \"[a]t no point in the Court's [July 30 Order] is [applicant] precluded or restrained from publishing matters which are public record, nor is [applicant] enjoined or restrained from broadcasting matters in this case.  The [July 30 Order] clearly provides that the parties to this action are enjoined from further disclosing the contents of the transcript of testimony before the Grand Jury to any person not authorized by F. S. 905.27(2).  The parties to this action are the State of Florida . . . and defense counsel.\" Order on Motion to Intervene, etc., in No. CF04-1478 (Fla Cir Ct, Aug. 9, 2004), pp 1-2, App. in Support of Stay Application, Tab 10 (hereinafter Aug. 9 Order).  The court declined to hold a hearing on applicant's motion because \"the Court's order does not enjoin the [applicant] from publishing or broadcasting materials that it wishes to publish or broadcast, but rather solely points out that so to do might constitute further violations of criminal law.\" Id., at 2.  The court denied applicant's motion to intervene and its motion to set aside the July 30 Order. \n\nApplicant sought review in the Fifth District Court of Appeal of Florida, which denied, without comment, applicant's \"Emergency Petition for Writ of Certiorari.\" On the basis that the Fifth District Court of Appeal's denial is not appealable to the Florida Supreme Court, see Fla. Rule App. Proc. 9.030(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2005), applicant filed with me as Circuit Justice an application for a stay of the orders, urging that they operate as a prior restraint in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  The application for a stay is denied.  It is not sufficiently established on this record that applicant is enjoined by or otherwise subject to the orders in question or that any threat to it is real or substantial; hence it is unlikely that, despite indications that a prior restraint may have been imposed at the time of the first order, four Members of the Court would vote to grant certiorari. \n\n II \n\nApplicant argues that the orders operate as a prior restraint because they threaten prosecution for future disclosures of the transcript and for contempt of court for any future publication.  Specifically, the July 30 Order, at 2, places \"[a]ll persons who have obtained a copy of the transcript . . . on notice that any broadcast, publication, disclosure or communication of the contents of this transcript is a violation of F. S. 905.27, punishable as a misdemeanor in addition to constituting grounds for Criminal Contempt of Court.\" This would apply to applicant, as it  fell within the class of persons who had obtained a copy of the transcript. \n\n A threat of prosecution or criminal contempt against a specific publication raises special First Amendment concerns, for it may chill protected speech much like an injunction against speech by putting that party at an added risk of liability.  The court's first order was not accompanied by notice or hearing or any other of the usual safeguards of the judicial process.  It bears many of the marks of a prior restraint. See Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,372 U.S. 58, 9 L. Ed. 2d 584, 83 S. Ct. 631 (1963). \n\n The first order is of further concern because it singles out this applicant and could be interpreted to place it on notice that publication of grand jury testimony in the underlying case could subject it to prosecution or place it in contempt of court.  Assuming that order constituted a prior restraint, however, any chilling effect it had on speech was substantially diminished by the court's second order. \n\nThat second order indicates that the court was directing its order only to the conduct of those who are parties to the underlying action.  Applicant is not a party.  See Aug. 9 Order, at 1 (\"The Court's order clearly provides that the parties to this action are enjoined . . .\"); id., at 2 (\"[T]he Court's order does not enjoin the movant [applicant] in this case . . .\").  In this respect the orders themselves, by their terms, do not prohibit speech by this applicant. \n\n In addition, the second order forecloses interpreting the first order to put applicant on notice that future publication would place it in contempt. It notes that \"the Court's order does not enjoin [applicant] from publishing or broadcasting materials that it wishes to . . . but rather solely points out that so to do might constitute further violations of criminal law.\" Ibid.\n\nTo the extent the court's orders might suggest a particular animus toward applicant, that, too, has abated by virtue of the fact that the judge who entered them has retired from judicial service. \n\nApplicant argues that aside from the possibility of being held in contempt, it fears prosecution by virtue of the orders.  Although it is true that \"[p]eople do not lightly disregard public officers' thinly veiled threats to institute criminal proceedings,\" Bantam Books, supra, at 68, 9 L. Ed. 2d 584, 83 S. Ct. 631, there is no suggestion that the judge who entered the orders here could institute such a proceeding. In Florida, it does not appear that the court may itself institute a prosecution for a violation of Fla. Stat.  § 905.27 (2003).  The decision to charge and prosecute is an executive responsibility, and the state attorney has complete discretion in deciding whether and how to do so.  See State v. Bloom, 497 So. 2d 2, 3 (Fla. 1986) (citing Fla. Const., Art. II, § 3).  See also State v. Johns, 651 So. 2d 1227, 1228 (Fla. App. 1995) (\"The decision of whether to prosecute for a criminal offense is a function of the executive authority, not the trial court\").  The court's orders are thus not a prerequisite to prosecution, nor does the application demonstrate that prosecution is any more likely because of them.  If prosecutors deemed applicant's future publication to constitute a violation of Fla. Stat.  § 905.27 (2003), they would be free to prosecute applicant with or without the court's orders.   The court recognized as much when it stated in its Aug. 9 Order, at 2, that \"[t]he question of whether the publication or broadcast of this information is a crime, is one  which must be left up to further investigation and proper prosecution.\" \n\nAlthough the State has not guaranteed applicant immunity from prosecution for future publication of the transcript, it has suggested that further publication will not be prosecuted.  See State's Response to Application to Stay Prior Restraint Order 4-5 (\"Because the State Attorney did not believe that Petitioner violated the grand jury secrecy statute . . . further publication of the grand jury transcript would not have resulted in prosecution\"). \n\n True, informal procedures undertaken by officials and designed to chill expression can constitute a prior restraint. See Bantam Books, supra. Warnings from a court have added weight, and this too has a bearing on whether there is a prior restraint. If it were to be shown that even the second order might give a reporter or television station singled out earlier any real cause for concern, the case for intervention would be stronger.  It appears, however, that any threat once implicit in the court's first order is much diminished. The two orders, issued by a judge no longer in office, appear to have been isolated phenomena, not a regular or customary practice.  Cf.  ibid. Under these circumstances, in my view, there is no reasonable probability this Court would grant a writ of certiorari. See Graves v. Barnes,405 U.S. 1201, 1203, 30 L. Ed. 2d 769, 92 S. Ct. 752 (1972) (Powell, J., in chambers).  The application for a stay of the orders pending the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. \n\nIt is so ordered.  \n\n"

         "Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n The State of Alaska has invoked our original jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with the United States over title to certain submerged lands underlying waters located in southeast Alaska.  Alaska initiated the action by filing a complaint with leave of the Court.  530 U.S. 1228, 147 L. Ed. 2d 272, 120 S. Ct. 2681 (2000).  We appointed Professor Gregory E. Maggs to act as Special Master in this matter.  531 U.S. 941, 148 L. Ed. 2d 271, 121 S. Ct. 337 (2000).  The Special Master gave thorough consideration to the written and oral submissions of the parties.  In a detailed report he now recommends the grant of summary judgment to the United States with respect to all the submerged lands in dispute.  Report of Special Master 1 (hereinafter Report or Special Master's Report).  We set the case for oral argument on Alaska's exceptions to the Special Master's Report.  543 U.S. ___, 543 U.S. 953, 160 L. Ed. 2d 314, 125 S. Ct. 458 (2004).  For the reasons we discuss, Alaska's exceptions are overruled. \n\nI \n\n We begin by reviewing the general principles elaborated in the resolution of similar submerged lands disputes in our earlier cases. \n\nStates enjoy a presumption of title to submerged lands beneath inland navigable waters within their boundaries and  beneath territorial waters within three nautical miles of their coasts. This presumption flows from two sources.  Under the established rule known as the equal footing doctrine, new States enter the Union \"on an 'equal footing' with the original 13 Colonies and succeed to the United States' title to the beds of navigable waters within their boundaries.\" United States v. Alaska, 521 U.S. 1, 5, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (1997)(Alaska (Arctic Coast)).Under the Submerged Lands Act (SLA), 67 Stat. 29, 43 U.S.C. § 1301 et seq., which applies to Alaska through an express provision of the Alaska Statehood Act (ASA), § 6(m), 72 Stat. 343, the presumption of state title to \"lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective States\" is \"confirmed\" and \"established.\" 43 U.S.C. § 1311(a); see also Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 5-6, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  The SLA also \"establishes States' title to submerged lands beneath a 3-mile belt of the territorial sea, which would otherwise be held by the United States.\" Id., at 6, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  \"As a general matter, then, Alaska is entitled under both the equal footing doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act to submerged lands beneath tidal and inland navigable waters, and under  the Submerged Lands Act alone to submerged lands extending three miles seaward of its coastline.\" Ibid.\n\n The Federal Government can overcome the presumption and defeat a future State's title to submerged lands by setting them aside before statehood in a way that shows an intent to retain title.  Id., at 33-34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  The requisite intent must, however, be \"'definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.'\" Id., at 34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (quoting United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U.S. 49, 55, 70 L. Ed. 465, 46 S. Ct. 197 (1926)). \n\nWith these principles in mind, we discuss the two areas of submerged land at issue here. \n\nII \n\n The first area of submerged land in dispute, claimed by Alaska under alternative theories in counts I and II of its  amended complaint to quiet title (hereinafter Amended Complaint), consists of pockets and enclaves of submerged lands underlying waters in between and fringing the southeastern Alaska islands known as the Alexander Archipelago.  These disputed submerged lands, shown in red and dark blue on the map in Appendix A, infra, share a common feature: All points within the pockets and enclaves are more than three nautical miles from the coast of the mainland or of any individual island of the Alexander Archipelago. \n\nFor these pockets and enclaves, the dispositive question is whether the Alexander Archipelago's waters qualify as inland waters. If they do, Alaska's coastline would begin at the outer bounds of these inland waters as marked by the black line drawn on the map in Appendix A, infra. See 43 U.S.C. § 1301(c)(\"The term 'coast line' means the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters\"); see also United States v. Alaska, 422 U.S. 184, 187-188, 45 L. Ed. 2d 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240, and n. 5 (1975)(Alaska (Cook Inlet)).Under the equal footing doctrine and the SLA, a presumption of state title would then arise as to all the submerged lands underlying both the inland waters landward of this coastline, and also the territorial sea within three nautical miles of it.  Because the United States concedes it could not rebut the presumption of state title as to this aspect of the case, Alaska would have title to all the pockets and enclaves of submerged lands in dispute. \n\nIf the Alexander Archipelago's waters do not qualify as inland, then they instead qualify as territorial sea. In that case Alaska would have no claim of title to the disputed pockets and enclaves, as these lands are beyond three nautical miles from the coast of the mainland or any individual island. \n\n The second area of submerged land in dispute, claimed by Alaska in count IV of its Amended Complaint, consists of the submerged land beneath Glacier Bay, a well-marked indentation into the coast of the southeast Alaskan mainland. See  Appendixes C, D, infra (maps of Glacier Bay).  There is no question that Glacier Bay's waters are inland. For the submerged lands underlying these waters, the controlling question is whether the United States can rebut Alaska's presumption of title. \n\n After receiving the parties' written submissions and conducting a hearing, the Special Master recommended that this Court grant summary judgment to the United States with respect to Alaska's claims of title to both areas of submerged land in dispute.  Report 1.  As to the pockets and enclaves, the Special Master concluded that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago do not qualify as inland waters either under the historic inland waters theory advanced in count I of Alaska's Amended Complaint or under the juridical bay theory advanced in count II.  Id., at 137-138, 226.  As to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay and claimed by Alaska in count IV, the Special Master concluded that the United States has rebutted the presumption that title passed to Alaska at statehood. Id., at 276.  Alaska filed exceptions to each of these three conclusions.  We address them in turn. \n\nIII \n\n In count I of its Amended Complaint, Alaska alleges that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago are historic inland waters. As this Court has recognized, \"where a State within the United States wishes to claim submerged lands based on an area's status as historic inland waters, the State must demonstrate that the United States:  (1) exercises authority over the area; (2) has done so continuously; and (3) has done so with the acquiescence of foreign nations.\" Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 11, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  \"For this showing,\" we have elaborated, \"the exercise of sovereignty must have been, historically, an assertion of power to exclude all foreign vessels and navigation.\" Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at 197, 45 L. Ed. 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240. \n\n Nations may exclude from inland waters even vessels engaged in so-called \"innocent passage\"--passage that \"is not  prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State,\" Arts. 14(1), 14(4) of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, Apr. 29, 1958, [1964] 15 U. S. T. 1607, 1610 T. I. A. S. No. 5639 (hereinafter Convention).  See United States v. Louisiana, 470 U.S. 93, 113, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074 (1985)(Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case);United States v. Louisiana, 394 U.S. 11, 22, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773 (1969).  To claim a body of water as historic inland water, it is therefore important to establish that the right to exclude innocent passage has somehow been asserted, even if never actually exercised.  See Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, 470 U.S., at 113, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074.  The Court also has considered the \"vital interests of the United States\" in designating waters as historic inland waters. Id., at 103, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074. \n\n The Special Master recommended that the Court grant summary judgment to the United States on this count.  The Special Master first made a thorough examination of historical documents, from 1821 to the present, bearing on the status of the Alexander Archipelago's waters. The Special Master sorted these documents into five distinct periods: (1) Russian sovereignty (1821-1867), Report 23-38; (2) early American sovereignty (1867-1903), id., at 38-55; (3) the 1903 US-Britain Boundary  Arbitration, id., at 56-63; (4) later American sovereignty (1903-1959), id., at 63-89; and (5) the poststatehood era (1959-present), id., at 89-107.  Based on his examination of the record evidence from all of these periods, the Special Master concluded that \"Russia and the United States historically did not assert authority to exclude vessels from making innocent passage through the waters of the Alexander Archipelago.\" Id., at 109.  In the Special Master's view, Alaska had at best \"uncovered and presented only 'questionable evidence' that the United States exercised the kind of authority over the waters of the Archipelago that would be necessary to prove a historic waters claim.\" Id., at 129. \n\n Though Alaska's failure to demonstrate that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago had historically been treated as inland waters would by itself justify granting summary judgment to the United States on count I, the Special Master also addressed other relevant factors, such as the acquiescence of other nations and the vital interests of the United States.  In the Special Master's view these factors only strengthened the case for granting summary judgment to the United States. \n\nExcepting to the Special Master's recommendation on count I, Alaska contends the Special Master gave too little weight to historical events that tend to support Alaska's position.  By the same token Alaska argues the Special Master gave too much weight to historical events that tend to undermine its position.  Alaska also asserts that foreign nations have acquiesced in the treatment of the waters of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters, and that the interests of the United States support such treatment.  We find Alaska's arguments unconvincing. \n\n Rather than canvassing the entire historical record discussed by the Special Master in his thorough, commendable report, we turn our attention to the events Alaska presents as its best evidence that the Alexander Archipelago's waters qualify as historic inland waters. \n\nA \n\n First in time among the events to which Alaska points are incidents from the period of Russian sovereignty.  These incidents are pertinent to the inquiry because, as we have held, when Russia ceded the territory of Alaska to the United States in 1867, \"the United States thereby acquired whatever dominion Russia had possessed.\" Alaska (Cook Inlet), 422 U.S., at 192, n. 13, 45 L. Ed. 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240. \n\n In 1824, the United States and Russia entered into a treaty that, inter alia, granted United States vessels the right, over  the next 10 years, to \"frequent, without any hindrance whatever, the interior seas, gulphs, harbours, and creeks [of the Alexander Archipelago], for the purpose of fishing and trading with the natives of the country.\" See Convention Between the United States of America and Russia, Art. 4, 8 Stat. 304 (1825) (hereinafter 1824 Treaty or Treaty).  In Alaska's view this Treaty demonstrates that \"the Russian claim extended to the entire Archipelago\" and thus that Russia treated the archipelago waters as inland waters. Exceptions to Report of Special Master and Brief in Support for Plaintiff 29 (hereinafter Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska).  The principal problem with Alaska's assertion is that the 1824  Treaty by its terms did not address navigation for the purpose of innocent passage, but rather addressed only navigation \"for the purpose of fishing and trading with the natives.\" Even on the questionable assumption that the Treaty's reference to \"interior seas\" included all the waters of the Alexander Archipelago and not just waters within three nautical miles of the coast of the mainland or any particular island, but see Report 27-28 (refuting this assumption), the Treaty simply does not provide evidence that Russia asserted a right to exclude innocent passage.  Yet evidence of the assertion of this right--not some lesser right--must be provided to support an historic inland waters claim.  See Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at 197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240. \n\nUpon the expiration of the 10-year right granted to United States vessels by virtue of the 1824 Treaty, Russia stationed a brig, theChichagoff, at the southern border of Russian America.  Alaska implies that Russia's purpose in stationing the brig there was to exclude any foreign vessels from entering the Alexander Archipelago's waters. See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 30-31.  Were we to accept this interpretation of the Chichagoff incident, we would acknowledge it as some evidence that Russia treated the Alexander Archipelago's waters as inland waters. \n\n As the Special Master noted, however, a report prepared for the 1903 Alaskan Boundary Tribunal (a tribunal we will discuss further) described the Chichagoff incident as follows: \"Governor Wrangell sent the brig Chichagoff, under command of Lieutenant Zarembo, to Tongas, near the southern boundary line at 54degree 40ft, for the purpose of intercepting foreign vessels entering the inland waters of the colony, to the masters of which he was to deliver written notice of the expiration of the treaty provisions, being furnished with six copies for American and three for British vessels.\" 1 Proceedings of the Alaskan Boundary Tribunal, S. Doc. No. 162, 58th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p 70 (1904) (hereinafter ABT proceedings) (footnote omitted).\n\nLike the Special Master, we see nothing in this passage to indicate that Russia, through its actions with respect to the Chichagoff, asserted a right to exclude from the Alexander Archipelago waters foreign vessels engaged only in innocent passage.  By giving written notice of the expiration of the 1824 Treaty rights, the Chichagoff reminded American mariners that they were no longer free to trade with the natives, or to approach within cannon shot of the Russian lands \"without any hindrance whatever.\" 1824 Treaty, Art. 4, 8 Stat. 304.  Russia did not assert thereby the more sweeping right to exclude even vessels engaged only in innocent passage. \n\nAlaska also points to evidence that in 1836 Russian forces apprehended and boarded the American vessel Loriot while it was within the Alexander Archipelago waters, and then ordered it \"'to leave the waters of His Imperial Majesty.'\" Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 30; see also Letter from John Forsyth to G. M. Dallas (May 4, 1837), reprinted in Report of Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard upon the Seal Fisheries in the Bering Sea, S. Exec. Doc. No. 106, 50th Cong., 2d Sess., 232-233 (1889).  Even this incident does  not  constitute evidence that Russia viewed the archipelago waters as inland waters, however, because the Loriot was not engaged in innocent passage.  The Loriot's mission, as freely admitted in a contemporary letter written by a State Department official to a member of the United States legation in St. Petersburg, was to visit \"the northwest coast of America, for the purpose of procuring provisions, and also Indians to hunt for sea otter on the said coast.\" Id., at 232.  By excluding the Loriot, which evidently had tried to exceed the limits of mere \"innocent passage,\" Russia did not, and could not, assert a right to exclude vessels engaged solely in innocent passage. \n\nIn sum, none of the incidents Alaska cites from the period of Russian sovereignty support the proposition that Russia treated the waters of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters prior to ceding Alaska to the United States in 1867. \n\nB \n\nFor the period of early U.S. sovereignty between 1867 and 1903, Alaska cites not a single incident demonstrating that the United States acted in a manner consistent with an understanding that the Alexander Archipelago waters were inland. Alaska thus leaves itself with at most 56 years to demonstrate continuous prestatehood treatment of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters. This alone constitutes a substantial weakness in Alaska's position. \n\nAs to the years between 1867 and 1903, Alaska does attempt to explain away a significant event which undercuts its claim, but this attempt is unsuccessful.  In 1886, Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard wrote a letter to Secretary of Treasury Daniel Manning concerning the limits of the territorial waters of the United States on both the northeastern and the northwestern coasts. See 1 J. Moore, Digest of International Law 718-721 (1906).  The State Department's position with respect to waters surrounding fringing islands on both coasts was that the sovereigns of those islands could  only claim a territorial sea of three miles from the coast of each island. Secretary Bayard explained that, in asserting the 3-mile belt of territorial sea, the United States denied neither \"the free right of vessels of other nations to pass, on peaceful errands, through this zone\" nor the right \"of relief, when suffering from want of necessities, from the shore.\" Id., at 720-721. \n\nAccording to Secretary Bayard, the State Department's position was a well-considered one, rooted in principles of reciprocity and consistent practice: \"These rights we insist on being conceded to our fishermen in the northeast, where the mainland is under the British sceptre.  We can not refuse them to others on our northwest coast, where the sceptre is held by the United States.  We asserted them . . . against Russia, thus denying to her jurisdiction beyond three miles on her own marginal seas. We can not claim greater jurisdiction against other nations, of seas washing territories which we derived from Russia under the Alaska purchase.\" Id., at 721 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Special Master singled out this letter as \"unambiguously support[ing] the United States' position that the United States and Russia historically  did not assert the right to exclude foreign vessels from the waters of the Archipelago.\" Report 109.  Emphasizing the statements in the letter that the United States could not \"'claim greater jurisdiction'\" than three miles of marginal seas and that foreign vessels had the right to make \"'free transit,'\" the Special Master concluded that \"[o]fficials who held this belief could not, and evidently did not, claim that the United States could exclude innocent passage through the waters.\" Id., at 110. \n\nAlaska argues that Secretary Bayard's letter is of minimal relevance because \"it was internal correspondence that primarily addressed a dispute on the East coast\" and thus \"did not announce to any foreign nation that the United States had abandoned a claim to the Archipelago.\" Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 31-32.  Alaska's arguments are unpersuasive.  That Secretary Bayard's letter referred to the east coast in no way diminishes the unequivocal nature of its statements with respect to the Alaskan coast. It may be true that no foreign nation ever became aware of Secretary Bayard's letter (though the subsequent publication of the letter in the United States' Digest of International Law gives us reason to believe the contrary).  Regardless, Secretary Bayard's letter still provides strong evidence that the United States, as of 1886, did not claim a right to exclude all foreign vessels from the Alexander Archipelago waters and had no intention of doing so.  We do not need to parse the letter to see whether it \"announce[d] to any foreign nation that the United States had abandoned a claim to the Archipelago,\" for Alaska can muster no proof that the United States as of 1886 had made any such claim in the first place. \n\nC \n\nA stronger piece of evidence Alaska identifies to support its historic inland waters claim is a litigating position taken by the United States during an arbitration proceeding in 1903.  This proceeding was before the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, a body convened to resolve a dispute between the United States and Britain regarding the land boundary between southeastern Alaska and Canada.  Report 56-63, 116-119. \n\nIn a written submission to the tribunal, the United States described its view of the \"political coast\" of Alaska as enclosing all of the Alexander Archipelago waters, as shown on the map in Appendix A, infra. 4 ABT Proceedings, pt. 1, pp 31-32 (1903).  According to the United States' submissions, \"[t]he boundary of Alaska,--that is, the exterior boundary from which the marine league [of the territorial sea] is measured,--runs along the outer edge of the Alaskan or Alexander Archipelago, embracing a group composed of  hundreds of islands.\" 5 id., pt. 1, at 15-16.  At oral argument before the tribunal, moreover, counsel for the United States made explicit that the recognition of such a \"political coast\" would render all waters landward of it \"just as much interior waters as the interior waters of Loch Lomond.\" 7 id., at 611 (1904). \n\nBefore the Special Master in the instant case, the United States sought to discount as mere hypothetical statements the submissions it had made at the tribunal a full century prior.  The Special Master rejected this view and instead agreed  with Alaska that in its submissions to the tribunal the United States \"was expressing a considered analysis of the [Alexander Archipelago] area, not merely speaking hypothetically for the purpose of showing a flaw in Britain's argument.\" Report 61.  Ultimately, however, the Special Master still concluded that the United States' submissions to the tribunal were \"not an adequate assertion of authority over the waters of the Alexander Archipelago.\" Id., at 118.  The Special Master noted that the issue before the 1903 tribunal was not \"[t]he status of the waters of the Alexander Archipelago,\" ibid., but rather the land boundary between southeast Alaska and Canada; that the United States' declarations regarding the status of the Alexander Archipelago took up \"only a few paragraphs in a seven volume record\"; and that \"[f]or these reasons, it would be unrealistic to conclude that counsel's assertions at the tribunal should have made foreign nations (other than Britain) aware that the United States was asserting a right to exclude them.\" Ibid.\n\n Alaska responds that the Special Master was incorrect to conclude that the United States' submissions in 1903 could not have made foreign nations other than Britain aware of its claim.  Alaska argues that Norway became aware of the United States' submissions and then relied on them in its dispute with the United Kingdom in the well-known Fisheries Case (U. K. v. Nor.), 1951 I. C. J. 116 (Judgment of Dec. 18).  As the Special Master explained, however, \"[t]he ability  of one foreign nation to discover the United States' argument when litigating a related issue . . . does not mean that foreign nations should have known of the United States' position.\" Report 118, n 34.  This reasoning carries particular force in light of the precedent a contrary conclusion would create.  If this Court were to recognize historic inland waters claims based on arguments made by counsel during litigation about nonmaritime boundaries, \"the United States would itself become vulnerable to similarly weak claims by other nations that would restrict the freedom of the seas.\" Reply Brief for United States in Response to Exceptions of the State of Alaska 15-16 (hereinafter Reply Brief for United States).  We are reluctant to create a precedent that would have this effect. \n\nD \n\n The litigating position taken by the United States at the ABT Proceedings at best would provide weak support for inland status of the Alexander Archipelago waters even were we to accept it as signaling a significant change from the view expressed in Secretary Bayard's letter of 1886; for there is little evidence that the United States later acted in a manner consistent with this litigating position.  Alaska says that the United States asserted control over the waters by enacting and enforcing fishery regulations in the Alexander Archipelago during the first half of the 20th century.  Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 25-29.  In particular, Alaska cites the 1906 Alien Fishing Act, 34 Stat. 263, which prohibited foreign, but not domestic, commercial fishing \"in any of the waters of Alaska.\" As its sole evidence that the Act was enforced even in the pockets and enclaves at issue, Alaska cites the seizure by the United States Coast Guard in 1924 of the Canadian vessel Marguerite,  whose captain was fined $100 for fishing in contravention of the Act. \n\nAssuming, arguendo, that the Marguerite was seized in one of the disputed pockets or enclaves, a point which the Special Master found unclear, Report 67-68, this one incident  hardly suffices to demonstrate a continuous policy.  Indeed, contrary authority exists.  In 1934 the Departments of State and Commerce exchanged letters expressing their shared understanding that the United States lacked the power to enforce the Act more than three miles from the shore of any island or the mainland. Id., at 70-71 (quoting Letter from Daniel C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce, to Secretary of State 1 (Sept. 5, 1934)(\"'Canadian fishermen may operate [in the Alexander Archipelago waters] so long as they remain outside the three mile limit'\" ); and Letter from William Phillips, Under Secretary of State, to Secretary of Commerce 1 (Sept. 13, 1934) (expressing appreciation for the assurance \"'that the Fishery laws and regulations will be enforced by the Bureau of Fisheries in conformity with the view that Canadian fishermen may operate [in the Alexander Archipelago waters] so long as they remain outside the three-mile limit'\".  This understanding was inconsistent with a view of the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland. Report 70-71, 110-111. \n\nEven were the seizure of the Marguerite taken as evidence of a right asserted by the United States in 1924, the official correspondence cited by the Special Master establishes that by 1934 the United States had reverted to the position taken in Secretary Bayard's 1886 letter.  As the United States observes, furthermore, the fact that Britain protested the seizure of the Marguerite indicates that any claim of right implied from that seizure was not one in which foreign nations acquiesced.  Reply Brief for United States 17, n 10. \n\nAlaska also refers to various poststatehood events which, in its view, confirm the status of the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland waters. We find insufficient prestatehood evidence to establish inland waters status in the first place, and so we find it unnecessary to discuss these further events. \n\n At best, Alaska's submissions before this Court establish that the United States made one official statement--in the 1903 Alaska Boundary Arbitration--describing the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland, and that the United States seized one foreign vessel--the Marguerite--in a manner arguably consistent with the status of those waters as inland. These incidents are insufficient to demonstrate the continuous assertion of exclusive authority, with acquiescence of foreign nations, necessary to support an historic inland waters claim.  Alaska's exception to the Special Master's recommendation on count I of the Amended Complaint is overruled. \n\nIV \n\n In count II of its Amended Complaint, Alaska presents an alternative theory to justify treating the Alexander Archipelago's waters as inland. Alaska's alternative theory is that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago in truth consist of two vast, but as yet unnoticed, juridical bays.  Waters within a juridical bay would be deemed inland waters. Art. 5(1) of the Convention, 15 U. S. T., at 1609. Thus, if accepted, Alaska's  theory would render all the Alexander Archipelago's waters inland waters to the extent they lie within the limits of the bays Alaska identifies.  For this reason, and because the United States would not be able to rebut the presumption of title that would arise from inland waters status, Alaska's alternative theory would require the Court to accept Alaska's claim of title to the pockets and enclaves in dispute. \n\n The parties agree that Alaska's claimed juridical bays would exist only if four of the Alexander Archipelago's islands--Kuiu Island, Kupreanof Island, Mitkof Island, and Dry Island--were deemed to be connected to each other and to the mainland. We have recognized that such \"assimilat[ion]\" of islands fringing the mainland is possible, albeit only in \"exceptional case[s]\" in which \"an island or group of islands . . . 'are so integrally related to the mainland that they are realistically parts of the \"coast.\"'\" United States v. Maine, 469 U.S. 504, 517, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992 (1985) (quoting United States v. Louisiana, 394 U.S., at 66, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773).  If the assimilation Alaska urges were accepted, the four islands Alaska has identified  would form a constructive peninsula extending from the mainland and dividing the Alexander Archipelago's waters in two.  To bolster its case, Alaska labels the waters north and south of this hypothetical peninsula the \"North Bay\" and the \"South Bay.\" See Appendix B, infra (map showing Alaska's hypothetical peninsula and the resulting bays). \n\n Were we to accept Alaska's hypothetical peninsula, we would then be required to determine whether North Bay and South Bay in fact qualify as juridical bays under the Convention, which we have customarily consulted for purposes of \"determining the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters of the States.\" United States v. Maine, supra, at 513, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992.  Article 7(2) of the Convention sets forth the following geographic criteria for deciding whether a body of water qualifies as a bay: \"For the purposes of these articles, a bay is a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain landlocked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation.\" 15 U. S. T., at 1609.\n\nThis definition can be understood to comprise a number of elements.  To apply the definition to a given body of water, one must first determine whether the body of water satisfies the descriptive test of being a \"well-marked indentation.\" One must then determine, among other things, whether the indentation's area satisfies the mathematical \"semi-circle\" test set forth in the second sentence of Article 7(2). \n\n After due consideration of the parties' arguments, the Special Master recommended that the Court reject Alaska's alternative theory.  The Special Master first conducted a detailed assessment of the propriety of assimilating the four  islands in question in order to form the constructive peninsula so critical to Alaska's theory.  Report 147-197.  Applying  the principles set forth in United States v. Maine, supra, at 514-520, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992, and United States v. Louisiana, supra, at 60-66, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773, the Special Master concluded that assimilation would be unwarranted save for two inconsequential channels that \"do not suffice to create the juridical bays alleged by Alaska.\" Report 197.  In the alternative, the Special Master concluded that, even were Alaska's hypothetical peninsula accepted, neither \"North Bay\" nor \"South Bay\" could satisfy the descriptive test that a proposed bay constitute a \"'well-marked indentation.'\" Id., at 222. \n\nExcepting to the Special Master's recommendations, Alaska makes a detailed argument that this Court's precedents regarding assimilation of islands support recognition of the constructive peninsula Alaska has identified.  Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 39-45.  Alaska further contends that, once this peninsula is recognized, the resulting bodies of water satisfy all the criteria set forth in the Convention.  Id., at 45-49. \n\nWe overrule Alaska's exception.  For the sake of brevity we assume, arguendo, that each of the islands in Alaska's hypothetical peninsula should be assimilated one to another (though we are aware of, and Alaska itself cites, no precedent foreign or domestic in which such a massive amount of successive assimilation has been accepted for the purpose of identifying a juridical bay).  Even with the benefit of this daunting doubt Alaska could not prevail, for its hypothetical bays do not satisfy the Convention's descriptive requirement of being well-marked indentations. \n\n To qualify as a well-marked indentation, a body of water must possess physical features that would allow a mariner looking at navigational charts that do not depict bay closing lines nonetheless to perceive the bay's limits, and hence to avoid illegal encroachment into inland waters. See G. Westerman, The Juridical Bay 82-85 (1987).  Alaska's hypothetical  bays do not possess these features.  We have been referred to no authority which indicates that a mariner looking at an unadorned map of the southeast Alaskan coast has ever discerned the limits of Alaska's hypothetical bays.  So subtle are these limits that even Alaska itself did not discover them until after it had filed its first complaint in this action.  Compare Complaint to Quiet Title (Nov. 24, 1999) with Amended Complaint (Dec. 14, 2000).  The test is what mariners see, not what litigators invent.  Alaska's hypothetical bays would not be discernible to the eye of the mariner. \n\n A comparison to United States v. Maine, 469 U.S., at 514-520, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992, makes clear the force of our conclusion.  In that case the Court considered whether Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound together qualify as a juridical bay.  In determining that they do, the Court held that Long Island itself should be assimilated to the mainland. Id., at 517-520, 83 L. Ed 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992.  The Court then determined that the resulting indentation formed by Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound satisfied the requirements of Article 7(2) of the Convention, including the descriptive requirement of being a \"well-marked indentation.\" Id., at 515, 519, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992. \n\n There is a critical difference between this body of water and the bodies of water Alaska has christened as North Bay and South Bay.  Even before this Court held that Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound qualified together as a juridical bay, mariners and geographers had recognized Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound as adjacent, cohesive bodies of water--indeed, as \"sound[s],\" which itself is a term used to describe a wide and deep bay, or a strait connecting other bodies of water. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2176 (1981) (defining \"sound\" as \"a long and rather broad inlet of the ocean generally with its larger part extending roughly parallel to the coast\"; \"a long passage of water connecting two larger bodies but too wide and extensive to be termed a strait\").  Nothing of the sort can be said of Alaska's claimed bays.  It is not just that no mariner and  no geographer (and not even Alaska's litigators) before this action recognized Alaska's claimed bays as bays or sounds.  It appears that no one before this action recognized Alaska's claimed bays as constituting cohesive bodies of water at all. \n\n Even accepting the constructive peninsula Alaska has crafted out of four separate islands within the Alexander Archipelago, Alaska's claimed bays still fail to qualify as \"well-marked indentations\" for purposes of the Convention.  For this reason, we reject the alternative theory Alaska urges in count II of its Amended Complaint.  Alaska's exception to the Special Master's recommendation on this count is overruled. \n\nV \n\n In count IV of its Amended Complaint, Alaska claims title to the submerged lands underlying the waters of Glacier Bay National Monument (now known as Glacier Bay National Park), located at the northern end of the Alexander Archipelago.  Concluding that the United States had rebutted Alaska's presumed title to these lands, the Special Master recommended granting summary judgment to the United States.  As with the other aspects of this case, the Special Master was correct in his interpretation and application of the controlling precedents and principles, and we overrule Alaska's exception to his recommendation. \n\nA \n\n The centerpiece of Glacier Bay National Park is Glacier Bay itself.  By contrast to the bays Alaska claims in count II, Glacier Bay is a textbook example of a juridical bay.  Its waters mark a dramatic indentation within the coastline of the Alaskan mainland. While the width of Glacier Bay's mouth measures 5 miles at most, the bay's waters stretch more than 60 miles into the mainland. See Appendix C, infra (map of Glacier Bay). \n\nGlacier Bay National Park is one of the Nation's largest national parks, embracing over 3.2 million acres, an area  larger than the State of Connecticut.  Rennicke, North to Wild Alaska, National Geographic Traveler 48, 55 (July/Aug. 1994).  John Muir, who first saw the bay and its surroundings in 1879, described it as a \"'solitude of ice and snow and newborn rocks.'\" Id., at 56.  One way to comprehend the solitude is to note that in the area of  Glacier Bay there are still not more than 10 miles of established hiking trails.  See id., at 50.  As the world's largest marine sanctuary, it is, in one sense, a water park. \n\nA ship in the waters of the Pacific in the Gulf of Alaska reaches Glacier Bay by heading shoreward to the east through Cross Sound and to Bartlett Cove, there turning to proceed through the bay in a generally northwest direction.  See Appendix D, infra. The entrance to the bay near Bartlett Cove is about 100 miles northwest of Juneau and still 600 miles southeast of Anchorage. \n\nThe bay owes its name to Captain Beardslee of the United States Navy, who, upon first entering the bay in 1880, was so impressed by the ice formations surrounding it that he called it Glacier Bay.  5 New Encyclopaedia Britannica 290 (15th ed. 2003).  A glacier is a large formation of perennial ice.  The definition used by the Special Master was a \"'mixture of ice and rock that moves downhill over a bed of solid rock or sediment under the influence of gravity.'\" Report 246.  Some of the glaciers in the region are tidewater glaciers, so called because they end at the water's edge.  Even large ships must take precautions near these glaciers, for ice can break off (a process called calving); and when a large segment plunges to the sea, it becomes an iceberg.  Ibid.\n\nThe weight of a glacier can cause it to move, either advancing to crush the life before it or receding to allow life forms to begin anew.  At Glacier Bay some of the glaciers are advancing, some are receding, and others seem to be stable.  See id., at 246-247. \n\nAt least in Glacier Bay, the extreme slowness suggested by the term \"glacial\" is inapt, for the ice once present where  the bay now extends receded with (in a geological context) astounding speed.  When Captain George Vancouver visited in 1794, the bay was but 5 miles inward from Bartlett Cove, while today it penetrates inland for over 60 miles. This retreat of the ice is \"considered the fastest glacial withdrawal in recorded history.  'Unzipping,' the geologists call it.  The landscape dancing in geologic time.\" Rennicke, supra, at 56.  The advance and retreat of the glaciers are of great interest to scientists, and in the areas of glacial recession the submerged floor of the bay is contoured or sculptured in ways that can be studied to learn more of glacial movement and geologic formations.  See Report 246-248. \n\nThe immense scene is one of remarkable beauty, and the waters, which accommodate large vessels, can be calm enough so that kayaks can be used to explore the bay and its surroundings.  Where glaciers have retreated either in the bay or on shore, the retreat reveals how a new life cycle begins.  Plant succession is of absorbing interest.  \"It can be almost like a chant: lichens and algae, moss and dryas, fireweed, willows, alder, and spruce.\" Rennicke, supra, at 56. \n\nThe bay and the surrounding shore and forest areas of the park sustain a chain of fish, bird, and animal life.  Over 200 avian species have been noted, most of these in or near the marine environment.  Glacier Bay: A Guide to Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska 78 (1983).  There are mussels and crabs on the shore, and in the bay's waters there are numerous fish, including herring  and salmon.  The light in the long days of summer, and the oxygen-rich waters, accelerate phytoplankton populations, and this is part of the food chain working up to the herring and salmon, then porpoises, seals, and sea lions.  The bay also has whales, including the humpback whale.  K. Jettmar, Alaska's Glacier Bay: A Traveler's Guide 53 (1997). \n\nIn the 1930's, when naturalists and other observers were supporting the movement to expand Glacier Bay National  Monument beyond its initial boundaries, the brown bear became the flagship species for the cause.  Declaration of Theodore R. Catton 51, Exhibits to Reply of United States in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Count IV of Amended Complaint, Tab No. 3 (Exh. U.S. IV-3).  One of the largest of omnivores, the brown bear's food in estuarine areas includes \"vegetation, invertebrates (clams, mussels, worms, barnacles, amphipods), carcasses of fish and marine mammals washed onto the beach, and winter-killed ungulates . . . .\" Declaration of Victor Barnes 3 (Exh. U.S. IV-6).  Brown bears find salmon in streams, and (with distressing frequency) they can swim to the small islands to raid the nesting places of birds and water fowl.  Id., at 9.  When bears swim in the bay, they are particularly vulnerable to hunters.  When he was considering the proposal to extend the boundaries of the Glacier Bay National Monument, President Franklin Roosevelt was angered by accounts of bears being shot from pleasure yachts.  Id., at 16. \n\n Reference to the complex ecosystem of Glacier Bay and the surrounding land is important for understanding the purposes that led the United States to create Glacier Bay National Monument. These purposes, in turn, inform the inquiry whether title to the submerged land underlying the waters of Glacier Bay National Monument passed to Alaska at statehood. See Idaho v. United States, 533 U.S. 262, 274, 150 L. Ed. 2d 326, 121 S. Ct. 2135 (2001) (describing the inquiry as encompassing the question whether \"the purpose of the reservation would have been compromised if the submerged lands had passed to the State\"); Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 42-43, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (noting that \"defeating state title . . . was necessary to achieve the United States' objective [of] securing a supply of oil and gas that would necessarily exist beneath uplands and submerged lands\"). \n\nB \n\n Owing to Glacier Bay's status as a juridical bay, its waters qualify as inland navigable waters. All the remaining waters  within the boundaries of Glacier Bay National Monument as it existed at statehood, moreover, lie less than three nautical miles from the coastline.  Under both the equal footing doctrine and the SLA, therefore, a strong presumption arises that title to the lands underlying all the waters in dispute in count IV of Alaska's Amended Complaint passed to Alaska at statehood. See supra, at 545 U.S. 75, 125 S. Ct. 2137, 162 L. Ed. 2d, 57, 69, 70; see also Alaska (Arctic Coast), supra, at 33-36, 138 L. Ed. 2d 213, 117 S. Ct. 1888.The controlling question here is whether the United States can rebut this presumption. \n\n It is now settled that the United States can defeat a future  State's presumed title to submerged lands not only by conveyance to third parties but also by setting submerged lands aside as part of a federal reservation \"such as a wildlife refuge.\" Idaho v. United States, supra, at 273, 150 L. Ed. 2d 326, 121 S. Ct. 2135; Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 33-34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  To ascertain whether Congress has made use of that power, we conduct a two-step inquiry.  We first inquire whether the United States clearly intended to include submerged lands within the reservation. If the answer is yes, we next inquire whether the United States expressed its intent to retain federal title to submerged lands within the reservation. Id., at 36, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888; Idaho v. United States, supra, at 273, 150 L. Ed. 2d 326, 121 S. Ct. 2135.  \"We will not infer an intent to defeat a future State's title to inland submerged lands 'unless the intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.'\" Alaska (Arctic Coast), supra, at 34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. (quoting Holt State Bank, 270 U.S., at 55, 70 L. Ed. 465, 46 S. Ct. 197). \n\n After careful consideration of the parties' arguments, the Special Master recommended granting summary judgment to the United States on Alaska's claim of title to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay.  Report 227-276.  His recommendation rested on two conclusions that track the two-part test developed in our precedents.  First, he concluded that in creating Glacier Bay National Monument the United States had reserved the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay and the remaining waters within the monument's boundaries.  Id., at 264.  Second, he concluded that § 6(e) of the ASA, 72 Stat. 340-341, note preceding 48 U.S.C. § 21, p 320, expressed Congressional intent to retain those submerged lands in federal ownership.  Report 276. \n\nAlaska takes exception only to the Special Master's second conclusion.  We nonetheless explain the Special Master's first conclusion (and our own), for it is a necessary part of the reasoning for the second step of the analysis. \n\nC \n\nWe need not detain ourselves long with the first part of the test regarding title to submerged lands.  In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge invoked the Antiquities Act of 1906, ch. 3060, 34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. § 431 et seq., to create Glacier Bay National Monument. Proclamation No. 1733,43 Stat. 1988(1925 Proclamation).  In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a proclamation expanding the monument to include all of Glacier Bay's waters and to extend the monument's western boundary three nautical miles out to sea. Proclamation No. 2330, 3 CFR 28 (Supp. 1939) (1939 Proclamation).  See Appendix C, infra (depicting both the initial boundaries established by the 1925 Proclamation and the expanded boundaries established by the 1939 Proclamation).  In 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a proclamation slightly altering the monument's boundaries, but leaving the bay's waters within them.  Proclamation No. 3089, 3 CFR 24 (Supp. 1955) (1955 Proclamation).  In 1980, Congress designated the monument as part of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and expanded the resulting reservation's boundaries.  16 U.S.C. § 410hh-2; see Appendix D, infra (map of Glacier Bay National Park).  For present purposes, however, the important point is that by the time Alaska achieved statehood in 1959, the Glacier Bay National Monument had already existed for 34 years as a federal reservation. \n\nAfter considering the evidence submitted by both parties, the Special Master concluded that \"the Glacier Bay National  Monument, as it existed at the time of statehood, clearly included the submerged lands within its boundaries.\" Report 263-264.  According to the Special Master, the descriptions of the monument in the 1925, 1939, and 1955 Proclamations themselves showed that the monument embraced submerged lands.  Id., at 232-242.  The Special Master also considered it significant that exclusion of the submerged lands would have undermined at least three of the purposes that led the United States to create Glacier Bay National Monument. Exclusion of the submerged lands would impair scientific study of the majestic tidewater glaciers surrounding the bay.  Id., at 245-251.  It would also impair efforts both to study and to preserve the remnants of \"'interglacial forests,'\" which can be found both above and below the tideline.  Id., at 251-253.  Finally, exclusion of the submerged lands would compromise the goal of safeguarding the flora and fauna that thrive in Glacier Bay's complex and interdependent ecosystem.  Id., at 253-263. \n\nThe Special Master, in our view, had ample support for his conclusions that all of these were purposes for creation of the monument, and each would be compromised were it to be determined that submerged lands were not included in the monument. His ultimate determination, that Glacier Bay National Monument included the submerged lands within its boundaries, has strong support in the precedents and in the whole record of the case.  Alaska has not filed a formal exception to this determination, and the four-sentence footnote in Alaska's brief which expresses disagreement with it, Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 10-11, n 4, does not in our view suffice to impeach its validity. \n\nD \n\nHaving established the proposition that the Glacier Bay National Monument, at the time of Alaska's statehood, included the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay, we turn to the remaining question: whether the United States \"'definitely declared or otherwise made very plain'\" its intent to defeat Alaska's title to these submerged lands.  Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 34, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (quoting Holt State Bank, 270 U.S., at 55, 70 L. Ed. 465, 46 S. Ct. 197). \n\n1 \n\n The requisite expression of intent might conceivably reside in the very proclamations that invoked the Antiquities Act of 1906 to create and then expand Glacier Bay National Monument. It is clear, after all, that the Antiquities Act empowers the President to reserve submerged lands.  United States v. California, 436 U.S. 32, 36, 56 L. Ed. 2d 94, 98 S. Ct. 1662 (1978). An essential purpose of monuments created pursuant to the Antiquities Act, furthermore, is \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such  means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" 16 U.S.C. § 1.  From these two premises it would require little additional effort to reach a holding that the Antiquities Act itself delegated to the President sufficient power not only to reserve submerged lands but also to defeat a future State's title to them.  Given the reasons motivating the creation of Glacier Bay National Monument and the overall complexity of the Glacier Bay ecosystem, it would be unsurprising to find that the relevant proclamations manifested intent to retain federal title. \n\nOne amicus has advanced this argument at length, and the United States foreshadows it in a footnote.  See Brief for National Parks Conservation Association as Amicus Curiae 6-7, 13-16; Reply Brief for United States 32, n 20.  If true, this argument would provide a powerful alternative basis for agreeing with the Special Master's recommendation to grant summary judgment to the United States with respect to Alaska's claim of title to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay. \n\n We need pursue this alternative basis no further, however.  In our view the provisions of the ASA themselves suffice to  overcome the state ownership presumption arising from the equal footing doctrine and the SLA and to reserve the submerged lands in Glacier Bay to the United States. \n\n2 \n\n The Special Master agreed with the United States that Congress expressed an intent to retain title to all of Glacier Bay National Monument, including the submerged lands within it, in § 6(e) of the ASA.  Report 276.  To understand § 6(e), we begin by considering its context within the ASA, its text, and the construction we have given to it in an earlier case. \n\nSection 5 of the ASA sets forth a guiding principle regarding title to property within Alaska's boundaries: \"TheState of Alaska and its political subdivisions, respectively, shall have and retain title to all property, real and personal,  title to which is in the Territory of Alaska or any of the subdivisions.  Except as provided in section 6 hereof, the United States shall retain title to all property, real and personal, to which it has title, including public lands.\" 72 Stat. 340.\n\nBased on this provision, the new State of Alaska acquired title to any property previously belonging to the Territory of Alaska.  The United States, in turn, retained title to its property located within Alaska's borders, \"including public lands,\" subject to certain exceptions set forth in § 6 of the ASA. \n\nOne of those exceptions is contained in § 6(e), which provides in pertinent part: \"All real and personal property of the United States situated in the Territory of Alaska which is specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska, under the provisions of the Alaska game law of July 1, 1943 (57 Stat. 301; 48 U.S.C., secs. 192-211), as amended, and under  the provisions of the Alaska commercial fisheries laws of June 26, 1906 (34 Stat. 478; 48 U.S.C., secs. 230-239 and 241-242), and June 6, 1924 (43 Stat. 465; 48 U.S.C., secs. 221-228), as supplemented and  amended, shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska by the appropriate Federal agency: . . . Provided, That such transfer shall not include lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife nor facilities utilized in connection therewith, or in connection with general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife.\" Id., at 340-341.\n\nThe first quoted part of § 6(e), the initial clause, directs a transfer to Alaska of any federal property located in Alaska and used \"for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska\" under three particular federal game and wildlife laws.  The next quoted part, the proviso, makes clear that the transfer directive in the initial clause has no application to \"lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife.\" \n\nIn Alaska (Arctic Coast), we held that the proviso of § 6(e) expressed congressional intent to retain title to a reservation such as the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), and that the statute's declaration of intent was sufficient to defeat Alaska's presumed title under both the equal footing doctrine and the SLA.  \"In § 6(e) of the ASA, Congress clearly contemplated continued federal ownership of certain submerged lands--both inland submerged lands and submerged lands beneath the territorial sea--so long as those submerged lands were among those 'withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife.'\" 521 U.S., at 56-57, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (quoting § 6(e)).  If the proviso of § 6(e) applies to Glacier Bay National Monument, as we held it applied to ANWR in Alaska (Arctic Coast), then it follows that title to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay did not pass to Alaska at statehood. \n\n To avoid this reasoning, Alaska first argues that the proviso is limited in scope to federal property already covered by the initial clause; because Glacier Bay is not covered by the initial clause, the State contends, it is not covered by the proviso either.  Alaska next argues that even assuming the scope of the proviso is broader than the initial clause,  Glacier Bay was not \"set apart\" \"for the protection of wildlife.\" We reject both of Alaska's arguments. \n\na \n\nRegarding the relationship between the initial clause and the proviso, Alaska contends the proviso applies only to wildlife refuges or reservations set aside under the three particular federal game and wildlife statutes named in the initial clause.  Glacier Bay National Monument was not set aside under any of these particular statutes, of course; so Alaska says that omission from the initial clause dictates omission from the proviso. The United States counters that the initial clause is confined to specific property but that the proviso is a statement of intent to retain federal title which extends to all reservations thus described without regard to the specific statutory authority under which the reservations were set aside. \n\n As the Special Master noted, generalizations about the relationship between a proviso and a preceding clause prove to be of little help in resolving the parties' disagreement about the scope of § 6(e)'s  proviso. Report 268.  Though it may be customary to use a proviso to refer only to things covered by a preceding clause, it is also possible to use a proviso to state a general, independent rule.  \"[A] proviso is not always limited in its effect to the part of the enactment with which it is immediately associated; it may apply generally to all cases within the meaning of the language used.\" McDonald v. United States, 279 U.S. 12, 21, 73 L. Ed. 582, 49 S. Ct. 218 (1929); see also 2A N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 47:08, p 238 (2000). \n\n We conclude that Alaska's narrow reading of the proviso is neither necessary nor preferred.  Section 6(e) begins with specificity.  It covers \"all real and personal property\" \"specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska\" as identified under three particular federal game and wildlife laws.  Those provisions, in turn, make clear that the initial clause's transfer requirement applies to facilities such as certain fish hatcheries, and likely would include specific types of equipment or even vehicles. \n\nHaving thus transferred the identified \"property,\" the section proceeds to state a more general reservation, using the word \"lands.\" \"Provided, [t]hat such transfer shall not include lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife nor facilities . . . .\" The lands here in question were in fact \"withdrawn or otherwise set apart,\" that is to say by the proclamations which created the monument. Though it may not be the usual style, it does not strike us as illogical for the draftsperson of a statute to write it so that it transfers some specific real and personal property and then proceeds to reserve lands in a much larger classification. \n\nAlaska's insistence that the proviso must be limited to what is contained at the outset is foreclosed as well by the decision in Alaska (Arctic Coast). In the proceedings leading up to that decision, Alaska had argued that § 6(e)'s proviso did nothing more than to except lands from the transfer effected in § 6(e)'s initial clause.  In Alaska's view, even lands covered by the proviso could still be transferred by virtue of the SLA made applicable to Alaska via § 6(m) of the ASA.  See Reply Brief for State of Alaska in United States v. Alaska, O. T. 1996, No. 84, Orig., pp 44-45. The Court rejected Alaska's view: \"If [the Arctic National Wildlife Range is covered by §6(e)'s proviso], then the United States retained title to submerged lands as well as uplands within the Range.  This is so despite § 6(m) of the Statehood Act, which applied the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 to Alaska.  The Submerged Lands Act operated to confirm Alaska's title to equal footing lands and to transfer title to submerged lands beneath the territorial sea to Alaska at statehood, unless the United States clearly withheld submerged lands within either category prior to statehood. In § 6(e) of the Statehood Act, Congress clearly contemplated continued federal ownership of certain submerged lands--both inland submerged lands and submerged lands beneath the territorial sea--so long as those submerged lands were among those 'withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife.'\" 521 U.S., at 56-57,  138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (emphasis in original).\n\nThus we have held that § 6(e)'s proviso operates not just negatively and parasitically, only to except refuges or reservations \"set apart\" for \"the protection of wildlife\" from the transfer effected by § 6(e)'s main clause, but also affirmatively and independently, as an expression of Congress' intent to retain federal ownership over all lands within such reservations. \n\nThis affirmative and independent expression of intent logically applies with just as much force to reservations that fall within § 6(e)'s initial clause as to those that do not.  It would have made little sense for Congress to differentiate between those two sets of reservations in making the broad statement of intent we have construed § 6(e)'s proviso to set forth.  It would have made even less sense to differentiate in such a way as to exclude reservations set aside pursuant to the Antiquities Act, like Glacier Bay National Monument. The differentiation suggested by Alaska's reading, moreover, cannot be discerned from the text of § 6(e)'s proviso, which covers all reservations set aside \"for the protection of wildlife,\" regardless of the specific authority under which those reservations were set aside. \n\n Alaska is correct to note that our decision in Alaska (Arctic Coast) did not directly address the relationship between the initial clause and the proviso in § 6(e).  As Alaska observes, it appears that we assumed the ANWR would fall within § 6(e)'s initial clause were it not for the proviso. Id., at 60-61, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  For the reasons we have explained,  however, the broad construction we gave to the proviso in Alaska (Arctic Coast) of necessity carries consequences for the relationship between it and the initial clause. \n\nb \n\nAnticipating the possibility that its narrow interpretation of the proviso might be rejected, Alaska raises one last argument.  The proviso does not reach Glacier Bay even under a broad view of the proviso's scope, Alaska contends, because Glacier Bay was not set apart \"for the protection of wildlife\" within the meaning of § 6(e). \n\nThis argument can be rejected without extended discussion.  As the Special Master noted and as we have recognized, Congress has made clear that one of the fundamental purposes of wildlife reservations set apart pursuant to the Antiquities Act is \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" 16 U.S.C. § 1.  Because Glacier Bay National Monument serves as habitat for many forms of wildlife, it was set aside in part for its preservation.  Any doubt as to this conclusion is dispelled by reference to the Presidential proclamations setting aside the monument, for the proclamations identify the study of flora and fauna as one of the express purposes of the reservation. 1925 Proclamation, 43 Stat. 1988; 1939 Proclamation, 3 CFR 28 (Supp. 1939).  As the Special Master observed, the study of flora and fauna necessarily requires their preservation.  Report 274. \n\n In sum we agree with the United States that the proviso is best read, in light of our prior interpretation of it in Alaska (Arctic Coast), as expressing an independent and general rule uncoupled from the initial clause.  Under the initial clause the United States obligated itself to transfer to Alaska equipment and other property used for general fish and wildlife management responsibilities Alaska was to undertake upon acquiring statehood. Under the proviso the United States expressed its intent, notwithstanding this property transfer, to retain ownership over all federal refuges and reservations set aside for the protection of wildlife, regardless of the specific statutory authority enabling the set-aside.  This expression of intent encompassed Glacier Bay National Monument, which was set aside \"for the protection of wildlife\" within the meaning of § 6(e).  The text thus defeated the presumption that the new State of Alaska would acquire title to the submerged lands underlying the monument's waters, including the inland waters of Glacier Bay. \n\nAlaska's exception to the Special Master's recommendation on count IV of Alaska's Amended Complaint is overruled. \n\nVI \n\n For the foregoing reasons, we overrule each of Alaska's exceptions to the Special Master's recommendations.  Alaska shall take title neither to the submerged lands underlying the pockets and enclaves of water at issue in counts I and II of its Amended Complaint nor to the submerged lands underlying the waters of Glacier Bay at issue in count IV.  As to Count III of Alaska's Amended Complaint, the parties and the Special Master are in agreement that this Court should confirm the United States' proposed disclaimer of title.  The proposed disclaimer is hereby accepted. \n\nThe parties are directed to prepare and submit to the Special Master an appropriate proposed decree for the Court's consideration.  The Court retains jurisdiction to entertain  such proceedings, enter such orders, and issue such writs as may become necessary or advisable to effect and supplement the forthcoming decree and the respective rights of the parties. \n\nIt is so ordered.

         "JUSTICE GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\n A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\" § 2255, P6(1). This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation. It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become \"final\" for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?\n\nIn accord with this Court's consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate  court mandate as the triggering date. For the purpose of starting the clock  on § 2255's one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court's affirmation of the conviction.\n\nI\n\nIn 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana. On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions. That court's mandate issued on December 15, 1998. See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals' mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment). Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari. The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals' judgment, see this Court's Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate court's mandate.\n\n On February 22, 2000 -- one year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expired -- Clay filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Congress has prescribed \"[a] 1-year period of limitation\" for such motions \"running from the latest of\" four specified dates. § 2255, P6. Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, as in the generality of cases, is the first: \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.\" § 2255, P6(1).\n\nRelying on Gendron v. United States, 154 F.3d 672, 674 (CA7 1998)(per curiam), the District Court stated that \"when a federal prisoner in this circuit does not seek certiorari . . ., the conviction becomes 'final' on the date the appellate court issues the mandate in the direct appeal.\" App. to Pet. for Cert.  8a. Because Clay filed his § 2255 motion  more than one year after that date, the court denied the motion as time barred.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit affirmed. That court declined Clay's \"invitation to reconsider our holding in Gendron,\" although it acknowledged that Gendron's \"construction of section 2255 represents the minority view.\" 30 Fed. Appx. 607, 609 (2002). \"Bowing to stare decisis,\" the court expressed \"reluctance to overrule [its own] recently-reaffirmed precedent without guidance from the Supreme Court.\" Ibid.\n\n The Fourth Circuit has agreed with Gendron's interpretation of § 2255. See United States v. Torres, 211 F.3d 836, 838-842 (2000) (when a federal prisoner does not  file a petition for certiorari, his judgment of conviction becomes final for § 2255 purposes upon issuance of the court of appeals' mandate). Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways with the Seventh and Fourth Circuits. These courts hold that, for federal prisoners like Clay who do not file petitions for certiorari following affirmance of their convictions, § 2255's one-year limitation period begins to run when the defendant's time for seeking review by this Court expires. 1See Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 39-42 (CA1 2002); Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d 565, 567-577 (CA3 1999); United States v. Gamble, 208 F.3d 536, 537 (CA5 2000)(per curiam); United States v. Garcia, 210 F.3d 1058, 1059-1061 (CA9 2000); United States v. Burch, 202 F.3d 1274, 1275-1279 (CA10 2000); Kaufmann v. United States, 282 F.3d 1336, 1337-1339 (CA11 2002). To  secure uniformity in the application of § 2255's time constraint, we granted certiorari, 536 U.S. 957, 153 L. Ed. 2d 834, 122 S. Ct. 2658 (2002), and now reverse the Seventh Circuit's judgment. 2Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts of appeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitioner Clay in urging that Clay's § 2255 motion was timely filed. We therefore invited David W. DeBruin to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuit's judgment. Mr. DeBruin's able advocacy permits us to decide the case satisfied that the relevant issues have been fully aired.\n\nIIFinality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context. Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment. See, e.g., Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,517 U.S. 706, 712, 135 L. Ed. 2d 1, 116 S. Ct. 1712 (1996); Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 13, Comment b (1980). For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage. For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 18 U.S.C. § 3161 et seq., and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate court's mandate. See Brief for Amicus Curiae by Invitation of the Court 22-28 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases). For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, \"the time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).\" This Court's Rule 13(3).\n\nHere, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires. See, e.g., Caspari v. Bohlen,510 U.S. 383, 390, 127 L. Ed. 2d 236, 114 S. Ct. 948 (1994);Griffith v. Kentucky,479 U.S. 314, 321, n. 6, 93 L. Ed. 2d 649, 107 S. Ct. 708 (1987);Barefoot v. Estelle,463 U.S. 880, 887, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1090, 103 S. Ct. 3383 (1983);United States v. Johnson,457 U.S. 537, 542, n. 8, 73 L. Ed. 2d 202, 102 S. Ct. 2579 (1982);Linkletter v. Walker,381 U.S. 618, 622, n. 5, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601, 85 S. Ct. 1731 (1965). Because \"we presume that Congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with this Court's precedents,\" United States v. Wells,519 U.S. 482, 495, 137 L. Ed. 2d 107, 117 S. Ct. 921 (1997), our unvarying understanding  of finality for collateral review purposes would ordinarily determine the meaning of \"becomes final\" in § 2255.Amicus urges a different determinant, relying on verbal differences between § 2255 and a parallel statutory provision, 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(1), which governs petitions for federal habeas corpus by state prisoners. See  DeBruin Brief 8-20. Sections 2255 and 2244(d)(1), as now formulated, were reshaped by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. See §§ 101, 105, 110 Stat. 1217, 1220. Prior to that Act, no statute of limitations governed requests for federal habeas corpus or § 2255 habeas-like relief. See Vasquez v. Hillery,474 U.S. 254, 265, 88 L. Ed. 2d 598, 106 S. Ct. 617 (1986); United States v. Nahodil, 36 F.3d 323, 328 (CA3 1994). Like § 2255, § 2244(d)(1) establishes a one-year limitation period, running from the latest of four specified dates. Three of the four time triggers under § 2244(d)(1) closely track corresponding portions of § 2255. Compare §§ 2244(d)(1)(B)-(D), with § 2255, PP6(2)-(4). But where § 2255, P6(1), refers simply to \"the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final,\" § 2244(d)(1)(A) speaks of \"the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" 3The Courts of Appeals have uniformly interpreted \"direct review\" in § 2244(d)(1)(A) to encompass review of a state conviction by this Court. See Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d at 40-41; Williams v. Artuz, 237 F.3d 147, 151 (CA2 2001); Kapral v. United States, 166 F.3d at 575; Hill v. Braxton, 277 F.3d 701, 704 (CA4 2002); Ott v. Johnson, 192 F.3d 510, 513 (CA5 1999); Bronaugh v. Ohio, 235 F.3d 280, 283 (CA6 2000); Anderson v. Litscher, 281 F.3d 672, 674-675 (CA7 2002); Smith v. Bowersox, 159 F.3d 345, 347-348 (CA8 1998); Bowen v. Roe, 188 F.3d 1157, 1159 (CA9 1999); Locke v. Saffle, 237 F.3d 1269, 1273 (CA10 2001); Bond v. Moore, 309 F.3d 770, 774 (CA11 2002).\n\nWhen \"Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act,\" we have recognized, \"it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\" Russello v. United States,464 U.S. 16, 23, 78 L. Ed. 2d 17, 104 S. Ct. 296 (1983) (quoting United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972)). Invoking the maxim recited in Russello, amicus asserts that \"becomes final\" in § 2255, P6(1), cannot mean the same thing as \"became final\" in § 2244(d)(1)(A); reading the two as synonymous, amicus maintains, would render superfluous the words \"by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\" -- words found only in the latter provision. DeBruin Brief 8-20. We can give effect to the discrete wording of the two prescriptions, amicus urges, if we adopt the following rule: When a convicted defendant does not seek certiorari on direct review, § 2255's limitation period starts to run on the date the court of appeals issues its mandate. Id., at 36. 4Although recognizing that \"the question is not presented in this case,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, amicus suggests that § 2255's limitation period starts to run upon issuance of the court of appeals' mandate even in cases in which the defendant does petition for certiorari. Id., at 27-28, 36-38, 41-42. As amicus also recognizes, however, id., at 41, courts of appeals \"have uniformly concluded that, if a prisoner petitions for certiorari, the contested conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either denies the writ or issues a decision on the merits,\" United States v. Hicks, 350 U.S. App. D.C. 279, 283 F.3d 380, 387 (CADC 2002).\n\nAmicus would have a stronger argument if § 2255, P6(1), explicitly incorporated the first of § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s finality formulations but not the second, so that the § 2255 text read \"becomes final by the conclusion of direct review.\" Had § 2255 explicitly provided for the first of the two finality triggers set forth in § 2244(d)(1)(A), one might indeed question the soundness of interpreting § 2255 implicitly to incorporate § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s second trigger as well. As written, however, § 2255 does not qualify \"becomes final\" at all. Using neither of the disjunctive phrases that follow the words \"became final\" in § 2244(d)(1)(A), § 2255 simply leaves \"becomes final\" undefined.\n\nRussello, we think it plain, hardly warrants the decision amicus urges, one that  would hold the § 2255 petitioner to  a tighter time constraint than the petitioner governed by § 2244(d)(1)(A). Russello concerned the meaning of a provision in the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. § 1961 et seq., that directed forfeiture to the United States of \"any interest [a convicted defendant] has acquired . . . in violation of [the Act].\" § 1963(a)(1). The petitioner in Russello urged a narrow construction of the unqualified words \"any interest . . . acquired.\" Rejecting that argument, we observed that a succeeding subsection, § 1963(a)(2), reached \"any interest in . . . any enterprise\" the defendant conducted in violation of RICO's proscriptions. At that point, we referred to the maxim invoked by amicus. See supra, at 6. The qualifying words \"in . . . any enterprise\" narrowed § 1963(a)(2), but in no way affected § 1963(a)(1). The comparison of the two subsections, we said, \"fortified\" the broad construction we approved for the unmodified words \"any interest . . . acquired.\" Russello, 464 U.S., at 22-23 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 23 (\"Had Congress intended to restrict § 1963(a)(1) to an interest in an enterprise, it presumably would have done so expressly as it did in the immediately following subsection (a)(2).\").\n\nFar from supporting the Seventh Circuit's constricted reading of § 2255, P6(1), Russello's reasoning tends in Clay's favor. An unqualified term -- here \"becomes final\" -- Russello indicates, calls for a reading surely no less broad than a pinpointed one -- here, § 2244(d)(1)(A)'s specification \"became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\"\n\nMoreover, as Clay and the Government urge, see Brief for Petitioner 22; Reply Brief for United States 7-8, one can readily comprehend why Congress might have found it appropriate to spell out the meaning of \"final\" in § 2244(d)(1)(A) but not in § 2255. Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners. In that context, a bare reference to \"became final\" might have suggested that finality assessments  should be made by reference to state law rules that may differ from the general federal rule and vary from State to State. Cf.  Artuz v. Bennett,531 U.S. 4, 8, 148 L. Ed. 2d 213, 121 S. Ct. 361 (2000) (an application for state postconviction relief is \"properly filed\" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) \"when its delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable [state] laws and rules governing filings\"). The words \"by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\" make it clear that finality for the purpose of § 2244(d)(1)(A) is to be determined by reference to a uniform federal rule. Section 2255, however, governs only petitions by federal prisoners; within the federal  system there is no comparable risk of varying rules to guard against.\n\nAmicus also submits that 28 U.S.C. § 2263 \"reinforces\" the Seventh Circuit's understanding of § 2255. DeBruin Brief 20; accord, Torres, 211 F.3d at 840. Chapter 154 of Title 28 governs certain habeas petitions filed by death-sentenced state prisoners. Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from \"final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" That period is tolled, however, \"from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review.\" § 2263(b)(1).\n\nWe do not find in § 2263 cause to alter our reading of § 2255. First, amicus' reliance on § 2263 encounters essentially the same problem as does his reliance on § 2244(d)(1)(A): Section 2255, P6(1), refers to neither of the two events that § 2263(a) identifies as possible starting points for the limitation period -- \"affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review\" and \"the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\" Thus, reasoning by negative implication from § 2263 does not justify the conclusion that § 2255, P6(1)'s limitation period begins to run at one of those times rather than the other. Cf. supra, at 6-8. Second, § 2263(a) ties the applicable limitation period to \"affirmance of the conviction and sentence,\" while § 2255, P6(1), ties the limitation period to the date when \"the judgment of conviction becomes final.\" See Torres, 211 F.3d at 845 (Hamilton, J., dissenting). \"The Russello presumption -- that the presence of a phrase in one provision and its absence in another reveals Congress' design -- grows weaker with each difference in the formulation of the provisions under inspection.\" Columbus v. Ours Garage & Wrecker Service, Inc.,536 U.S. 424, 435-436, 153 L. Ed. 2d 430, 122 S. Ct. 2226 (2002).\n\n* * *\n\nWe hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, § 2255's one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires. Under this rule, Clay's § 2255 petition was timely filed. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nIt is so ordered.  \n\n"

         "Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\nIn most of the United States, not including California, the minimum price paid to dairy farmers producing raw milk is regulated pursuant to federal marketing orders.  Those orders guarantee a uniform price for the producers, but through pooling mechanisms require the processors of different classes of dairy products to pay different prices.  Thus, for example, processors of fluid milk pay a premium price, part of which goes into an equalization pool that provides a partial subsidy for cheese manufacturers who pay a net price that is lower than the farmers receive.  SeeWest Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,512 U.S. 186, 189, n. 1, 129 L. Ed. 2d 157, 114 S. Ct. 2205 (1994). \n\n The California Legislature  has adopted a similar program to regulate the minimum prices paid by California processors to California producers. In the cases before us today, out-of-state producers are challenging the constitutionality of a 1997 amendment to that program.  They present us with two questions: (1) whether § 144 of the Federal Agriculture  Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, 110 Stat 917, 7 USC § 7254 [7 USCS § 7254], exempts California's milk pricing and pooling regulations from scrutiny under the Commerce Clause; and (2) whether the individual petitioners' claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause is foreclosed because  those regulations do not discriminate on their face on the basis of state citizenship or state residence. \n\nI \n\nGovernment regulation of the marketing of raw milk has been continuous since the Great Depression. 1The history and purpose of federal regulation of milk marketing is described in some detail inZuber v. Allen,396 U.S. 168, 172-187, 24 L. Ed. 2d 345, 90 S. Ct. 314 (1969). In California, three related statutes establish the regulatory structure for milk produced, processed, or sold in California.  First, in 1935, the State enacted the Milk Stabilization and Marketing Act, Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. §§ 61801-62403 (West 2001), \"to establish minimum producer prices at fair and reasonable levels so as to generate reasonable producer incomes that will promote the intelligent and orderly marketing of market milk . . .\" § 61802(h).  Then, California created requirements for composition of milk products in the Milk and Milk Products Act of 1947. §§ 32501-39912.  The standards created under this Act mandate minimum percentages of fat and solids-not-fat in dairy products and often require fortification of milk by adding solids-not-fat. In 1967, California passed another milk pricing act, the Gonsalves Milk Pooling Act, §§ 62700-62731, to address deficiencies in the existing pricing scheme.  Together, these three Acts (including numerous subsequent revisions) create the state milk marketing structure: The 1935 and 1967 Acts establish the milk pricing and pooling plans, while the 1947 Act governs the composition of milk products sold in California. \n\nWhile it serves the same purposes as the federal marketing orders, California's regulatory program is more complex.   Federal orders typically guarantee all producers the same minimum price and create only two or three classes of end uses to determine the processors' contributions to, or withdrawals from, the equalization pools, whereas under the California scheme some of the farmers' production commands a \"quota price\" and some receives a lower \"overbase price,\" and the processors' end uses of the milk are divided into five different classes. \n\nThe complexities of the California scheme are not relevant to these cases; what is relevant is the fact California processors of fluid milk pay a premium price (part of which goes into a pool) that is higher than either of the prices paid to the producers. 2Because processors of fluid milk typically manufacture some other products as well, their respective pool contributions reflect the relative amounts of those end uses.  Each processor's mix of end uses produces an individual monthly \"blend price\" that is multiplied by its total purchases.  Under federal orders the term \"blend price\" has a different meaning; it usually refers to the price that the producer receives.  SeeWest Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy,512 U.S. 186, 189, n. 1, 129 L. Ed. 2d 157, 114 S. Ct. 2205 (1994). During the early 1990's,  market conditions made it profitable for some California processors to buy raw milk from out-of-state producers at prices that were higher than either the quota prices or the overbase prices guaranteed to California farmers yet lower than the premium prices they had to pay when making in-state purchases.  The regulatory scheme was at least partially responsible for the advantage enjoyed by out-of-state producers because it did not require the processors to make any contribution to the equalization pool on such purchases.  In other words, whereas an in-state purchase of raw milk resold as fluid milk required the processor both to pay a guaranteed minimum to the farmer and also to make a contribution to the pool, an out-of-state purchase at a higher price would often be cheaper because it required no pool contribution. \n\n In 1997, the California Department of Food and Agriculture amended its plan to require that contributions to the  pool be made on some out-of-state purchases. 3After the 1997 amendment, processors whose blend price exceeds the quota price must make contributions to the pool on their out-of-state purchases as well as their in-state purchases. It is the imposition of that requirement that gave rise to this litigation.  Petitioners in No. 01-950 operate dairy farms in Nevada; petitioners in No. 01-1018 operate such farms in Arizona.  They contend that the 1997 amendment discriminates against them.  In response, the California officials contend that it merely eliminated an unfair competitive advantage for out-of-state producers that was the product of the regulatory scheme itself. \n\nWithout reaching the merits of petitioners' constitutional claims, the District Court dismissed both cases and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 259 F.3d 1148 (2001).  Relying on its earlier decision inShamrock Farms Co. v. Veneman, 146 F.3d 1177 (1998), the court held that a federal statute enacted in 1996 had immunized California's milk pricing and pooling laws from Commerce Clause challenge.  It also held that the corporate petitioners had no standing to raise a claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and that the individuals' claim under that Clause failed because the 1997 plan amendments did not \"on their face, create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenship.\" 259 F.3d at 1156.  We granted certiorari to review those two holdings,537 U.S. 522, 537 U.S. 1099, 154 L. Ed. 2d 766, 123 S. Ct. 818 (2003), but in doing so we do not reach the merits of either constitutional claim. \n\nII \n\nIn some respects, the State's composition standards set forth in the 1947 Act exceed those set by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  For example, California's minimum standard for reduced fat milk requires that it contain at least 10 percent solids-not-fat (which include protein,  calcium, lactose and other nutrients).  Cal. Food & Agric. Code Ann. § 38211 (West 2001).  Federal standards require that reduced fat milk contain only 8.25 percent solids-not-fat.  See 21 CFR §§ 131.110, 101.62 (2002).  Some of California's standards were arguably pre-empted by Congress' enactment of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA), 104 Stat 2353, which contains a prohibition against the application of state quality standards to foods moving in interstate commerce. See 21 U.S.C. § 343-1(a) [21 USCS § 343-1(a)]. The District Court so held in Shamrock Farms Co. v Veneman, No. Civ-S-95-318 (ED Cal 1996).  In response to that decision, California sought an exemption from both the FDA and Congress.  SeeShamrock Farms, 146 F.3d at 1180.  Before the FDA acted, Congress responded favorably with the enactment of the statute that governs our disposition of these cases.  That statute, § 144 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, provides: \"Nothing in this Act or any other provision of law shall be construed to preempt, prohibit, or otherwise limit the authority of the State of California, directly or indirectly, to establish or continue to effect any law, regulation, or requirement regarding-- \"(1) the percentage of milk solids or solids not fat in fluid milk products sold at retail or marketed in the State of California; or \"(2) the labeling of such fluid milk products with regard to milk solids or solids not fat.\" 7 USC § 7254 [7 USCS § 7254].\n\nThereafter, Shamrock Farms brought another suit against the Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture challenging the validity of both the State's compositional standards and its milk pricing and pooling laws.  In that case, the Court of Appeals held that § 144 had immunized California's marketing programs as well as the compositional standards from a negative Commerce Clause challenge. Shamrock Farms,146 F.3d at 1182.  In adhering to that ruling in the cases before us today, the Ninth Circuit erred. \n\n The text of the federal statute plainly covers California laws regulating the composition and labeling of fluid milk products, but does not mention laws regulating pricing. Congress certainly has the power to authorize state regulations that burden or discriminate against interstate commerce,Prudential Ins. Co. v. Benjamin,328 U.S. 408, 90 L. Ed. 1342, 66 S. Ct. 1142 (1946), but we will not assume that it has done so unless such an intent is clearly expressed. South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke,467 U.S. 82, 91-92, 81 L. Ed. 2d 71, 104 S. Ct. 2237 (1984).While § 144 unambiguously expresses such an intent with respect to California's compositional and labeling laws, that expression does not encompass the pricing and pooling laws.  This conclusion is buttressed by the separate California statutes addressing the composition and labeling of milk products, on the one hand, and the pricing and pooling of milk on the other.  See supra, at 539 U.S. 59, 156 L. Ed. 2d 54, 59-60, 123 S. Ct. 2142 (2003).  The mere fact that the composition and labeling laws relate to the sale of fluid milk is by no means sufficient to bring them within the scope of § 144.  Because § 144 does not clearly express an intent to insulate California's pricing and pooling laws from a Commerce Clause challenge, the Court of Appeals erred in relying on § 144 to dismiss the challenge. \n\n III \n\n Article IV, § 2, of the Constitution provides: \"The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\"\n\nPetitioners, who include both individual dairy farmers and corporate dairies, have alleged that California's milk pricing laws violate that provision.  The Court of Appeals held that the corporate petitioners have no standing to advance such  a claim, and it rejected the individual petitioners' claims because the California laws \"do not, on their face, create classifications based on any individual's residency or citizenship.\" 259 F.3d at 1156.  Petitioners do not challenge the first holding, but they contend that the second is inconsistent with our decision inChalker v. Birmingham & Northwestern R. Co.,249 U.S. 522, 63 L. Ed. 748, 39 S. Ct. 366 (1919).  We agree. \n\nIn Chalker, we held that a Tennessee tax imposed on a citizen and resident of Alabama for engaging in the business of constructing a railroad in Tennessee violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The tax did not on its face draw any distinction based on citizenship or residence.  It did, however, impose a higher rate on persons who had their principal offices out of State.  Taking judicial notice of the fact that \"the chief office of an individual is commonly in the State of which he is a citizen,\" we concluded that the practical effect of the provision was discriminatory. Id., at 527, 63 L Ed 748, 39 S Ct 366.  Whether Chalker should be interpreted as merely applying the Clause to classifications that are but proxies for differential treatment against out-of-state residents, or as prohibiting any classification with the practical effect of discriminating against such residents, is a matter we need not decide at this stage of the case.  Under either interpretation, we agree with petitioners that the absence of an express statement in the California laws and regulations identifying out-of-state citizenship as a basis for disparate treatment is not a sufficient basis for rejecting this claim.  In so holding, however, we express no opinion on the merits of petitioners' Privileges and Immunities Clause claim. * * * \n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and these cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n\nIt is so ordered.  \n\n"

         "Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n We confront here the problem of a \"mixed\" petition for habeas corpus relief in which a state prisoner presents a federal court with a single petition containing some claims that have been exhausted in the state courts and some that have not.  More precisely, we consider whether a federal district court has discretion to stay the mixed petition to allow the petitioner to present his unexhausted claims to the state  court in the first instance, and then to return to federal court for review of his perfected petition. \n\n I \n\nPetitioner Charles Russell Rhines was convicted in South Dakota state court of first-degree murder and third-degree burglary and sentenced to death.  His conviction became final on December 2, 1996, when we denied his initial petition for certiorari.  Rhines v. South Dakota, 519 U.S. 1013, 136 L. Ed. 2d 410, 117 S. Ct. 522.  On December 5, 1996, Rhines filed a petition for state habeas corpus.  App. 32.  The state court denied his petition, and the Supreme Court of South Dakota affirmed on February 9, 2000, Rhines v. Weber, 2000 SD 19, 608 N.W.2d 303.Rhines filed his pro se petition for federal habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254] in the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota on February 22, 2000.  App 3.  Because the 1-year statute of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) was tolled while Rhines' state habeas corpus petition was pending, see 28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2244(d)(2)], he still had more than 11 months left before the expiration of the limitations period. \n\nWith the assistance of court-appointed counsel, Rhines filed an amended petition for writ of habeas corpus and statement of exhaustion on November 20, 2000, asserting 35 claims of constitutional defects in his conviction and sentence.  App. 39-60.  The State challenged 12 of those claims as unexhausted. Id., at 72-79.  On July 3, 2002, approximately 18 months after Rhines had filed his amended federal habeas corpus petition, the District Court held that 8 of the 35 claims had not been exhausted. At this time, the AEDPA 1-year statute of limitations had run.  See Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 181-182, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (2001) (holding that the statute of limitations is not tolled during the pendancy of a federal petition).  As a result, if the District Court had dismissed Rhines' mixed petition at that point, he would  have been unable to refile in federal court after exhausting the unexhausted claims.   Rhines therefore moved the District Court to hold his pending habeas petition in abeyance while he presented his unexhausted claims to the South Dakota courts.  On July 3, 2002, the District Court granted the motion and issued a stay \"conditioned upon petitioner commencing state court exhaustion proceedings within sixty days of this order and returning to this court within sixty days of completing such exhaustion.\" App. 136.  In compliance with that order, Rhines filed his second state habeas corpus petition on August 22, 2003. \n\nThe State appealed the District Court's stay of Rhines' mixed petition to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  Relying on its decision in Akins v. Kenney, 341 F.3d 681, 686 (2003) (holding that \"a district court has no authority to hold a habeas petition containing unexhausted claims in abeyance absent truly exceptional circumstances\" (internal quotation marks omitted)), the Court of Appeals vacated the stay and remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether Rhines could proceed by deleting unexhausted claims from his petition.  346 F.3d 799 (2003).  We granted certiorari to resolve a split in the Circuits regarding the propriety of the District Court's \"stay-and-abeyance\" procedure.  542 U.S. 936, 159 L. Ed. 2d 811, 124 S. Ct. 2905 (2004).  Compare, e.g., Crews v. Horn, 360 F.3d 146, 152 (CA3 2004); and Zarvela v. Artuz, 254 F.3d 374, 381 (CA2 2001), with 346 F.3d 799 (2003) (case below). \n\nII \n\n Fourteen years before Congress enacted AEDPA, we held in Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (1982), that federal district courts may not adjudicate mixed petitions for habeas corpus, that is, petitions containing both exhausted and unexhausted claims.  We reasoned that the interests of comity and federalism dictate that state courts must have the first opportunity to decide a petitioner's claims. Id., at 518-519, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.  We  noted that \"[b]ecause 'it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation,' federal courts apply the doctrine of comity.\" Id., at 518, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (quoting Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204, 94 L. Ed. 761, 70 S. Ct. 587 (1950)).  That doctrine \"'teaches that one court should defer action on causes properly within its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty with concurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation, have had an opportunity to pass upon the matter.'\" 455 U.S., at 518, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198. \n\n Accordingly, we imposed a requirement of \"total exhaustion\" and directed federal courts to effectuate that requirement by dismissing mixed petitions without prejudice and allowing petitioners to return to state court to present the unexhausted claims to that court in the first instance. Id., at 522, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198.  When we decided Lundy, there was no statute of limitations on the filing of federal habeas corpus petitions.  As a result, petitioners who returned to state court to exhaust their previously unexhausted claims could come back to federal court to present their perfected petitions with relative ease.   See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 486, 146 L. Ed. 2d 542, 120 S. Ct. 1595 (2000) (dismissal without prejudice under Lundy \"contemplated that the prisoner could return to federal court after the requisite exhaustion\"). \n\n The enactment of AEDPA in 1996 dramatically altered the landscape for federal habeas corpus petitions.  AEDPA preserved Lundy's total exhaustion requirement, see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(1)(A)] (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted unless it appears that . . . the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State\"), but it also imposed a 1-year statute of limitations on the filing of federal petitions, § 2244(d).  Although the limitations period is tolled during the pendency of a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review,\" § 2244(d)(2), the filing of a petition for habeas  corpus in federal court does not toll the statute of limitations,  Duncan, 533 U.S. at 181-182, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120. \n\n As a result of the interplay between AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations and Lundy's dismissal requirement, petitioners who come to federal court with \"mixed\" petitions run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims.  If a petitioner files a timely but mixed petition in federal district court, and the district court dismisses it under Lundy after the limitations period has expired, this will likely mean the termination of any federal review.  For example, if the District Court in this case had dismissed the petition because it contained unexhausted claims, AEDPA's 1-year statute of limitations would have barred Rhines from returning to federal court after exhausting the previously unexhausted claims in state court.  Similarly, if a district court dismisses a mixed petition close to the end of the 1-year period, the petitioner's chances of exhausting his claims in state court and refiling his petition in federal court before the limitations period runs are slim.  The problem is not limited to petitioners who file close to the AEDPA deadline.  Even a petitioner who files early will have no way of controlling when the district court will resolve the  question of exhaustion. Thus, whether a petitioner ever receives federal review of his claims may turn on which district court happens to hear his case. \n\n We recognize the gravity of this problem and the difficulty it has posed for petitioners and federal district courts alike.  In an attempt to solve the problem, some district courts have adopted a version of the \"stay-and-abeyance\" procedure employed by the District Court below.  Under this procedure, rather than dismiss the mixed petition pursuant to Lundy, a district court might stay the petition and hold it in abeyance while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his previously unexhausted claims.  Once the petitioner exhausts  his state remedies, the district court will lift the stay and allow the petitioner to proceed in federal court. \n\nDistrict courts do ordinarily have authority to issue stays, see Landis v. North American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254, 81 L. Ed. 153, 57 S. Ct. 163 (1936), where such a stay would be a proper exercise of discretion, see Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706, 137 L. Ed. 2d 945, 117 S. Ct. 1636 (1997).  AEDPA does not deprive district  courts of that authority, cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1)(A) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(1)(A)] (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus . . . shall not be granted unless it appears that . . . the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State\" (emphasis added)), but it does circumscribe their discretion.  Any solution to this problem must therefore be compatible with AEDPA's purposes. \n\n One of the statute's purposes is to \"reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital cases.\" Woodford v. Garceau,538 U.S. 202, 206, 155 L. Ed. 2d 363, 123 S. Ct. 1398 (2003).  See also Duncan, 533 U.S., at 179, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120.  AEDPA's 1-year limitations period \"quite plainly serves the well-recognized interest in the finality of state court judgments.\" Ibid. It \"reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality by restricting the time that a prospective federal habeas petitioner has in which to seek federal habeas review.\" Ibid.\n\n Moreover, Congress enacted AEDPA against the backdrop of Lundy's total exhaustion requirement. The tolling provision in § 2244(d)(2) \"balances the interests served by the exhaustion requirement and the limitation period,\" \"by protecting a state prisoner's ability later to apply for federal habeas relief while state remedies are being pursued.\" Duncan, supra, at 179, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120.  AEDPA thus encourages petitioners to seek relief from state courts in the first instance by tolling the 1-year limitations period while a \"properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\" is pending.  28 U.S.C. § 2244(d)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2244(d)(2)].  This scheme reinforces the importance of Lundy's \"simple and clear instruction to potential litigants: before you bring any claims to federal court,  be sure that you first have taken each one to state court.\" 455 U.S., at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198. \n\n Stay and abeyance, if employed too frequently, has the potential to undermine these twin purposes.  Staying a federal habeas petition frustrates AEDPA's objective of encouraging finality by allowing a petitioner to delay the resolution of the federal proceedings.  It also undermines AEDPA's goal of streamlining federal habeas proceedings by decreasing a petitioner's incentive to exhaust all his claims in state court prior to filing his federal petition.  Cf. Duncan, supra, 533 U.S., at 180, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251, 121 S. Ct. 2120 (\"[D]iminution of statutory incentives to proceed first in state court would . . . increase the risk of the very piecemeal litigation that the exhaustion requirement is designed to reduce\"). \n\n For these reasons, stay and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances.  Because granting a stay effectively excuses a petitioner's failure to present his claims first to the state courts, stay and abeyance is only appropriate when the district court determines there was good cause for the petitioner's failure to exhaust his claims first in state court.  Moreover, even if a petitioner had good cause for that failure, the district court would abuse its discretion if it were to grant him a stay when his unexhausted claims are plainly meritless.  Cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(2) [28 U.S.C.S. § 2254(b)(2)] (\"An application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the  failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State\"). \n\nEven where stay and abeyance is appropriate, the district court's discretion in structuring the stay is limited by the timeliness concerns reflected in AEDPA.  A mixed petition should not be stayed indefinitely.  Though, generally, a prisoner's \"principal interest . . . is in obtaining speedy federal relief on his claims,\" Lundy, supra, at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion), not all petitioners have an incentive to obtain federal relief as quickly as possible.  In particular, capital petitioners might deliberately engage in dilatory tactics to prolong their  incarceration and avoid execution of the sentence of death.  Without time limits, petitioners could frustrate AEDPA's goal of finality by dragging out indefinitely their federal habeas review.  Thus, district courts should place reasonable time limits on a petitioner's trip to state court and back.  See, e.g., Zarvela, 254 F.3d, at 381 (\"[District courts] should explicitly condition the stay on the prisoner's pursuing state court remedies within a brief interval, normally 30 days, after the stay is entered and returning to federal court within a similarly brief interval, normally 30 days after state court exhaustion is completed\").  And if a petitioner engages in abusive litigation tactics or intentional delay, the district court should not grant him a stay at all.  See id., at 380-381. \n\n On the other hand, it likely would be an abuse of discretion for a district court to deny a stay and to dismiss a mixed petition if the petitioner had good cause for his failure to exhaust, his unexhausted claims are potentially meritorious, and there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. In such circumstances, the district court should stay, rather than dismiss, the mixed petition.  See Lundy, 455 U.S., at 522, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (the total exhaustion requirement was not intended to \"unreasonably impair the prisoner's right to relief\").  In such a case, the petitioner's interest in obtaining federal review of his claims outweighs the competing interests in finality and speedy resolution of federal petitions.  For the same reason, if a petitioner presents a district court with a mixed petition and the court determines that stay and abeyance is inappropriate, the court should allow the petitioner to delete the unexhausted claims and to proceed with the exhausted claims if dismissal of the entire petition would unreasonably impair the petitioner's right to obtain federal relief.  See id., at 520, 71 L. Ed. 2d 379, 102 S. Ct. 1198 (plurality opinion) (\"[A petitioner] can always amend the petition to delete the unexhausted claims, rather than returning to state court to exhaust all of his claims\"). \n\n The Court of Appeals erred to the extent it concluded that stay and abeyance is always impermissible.  We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for that court to determine, consistent with this opinion,  whether the District Court's grant of a stay in this case constituted an abuse of discretion. \n\nIt is so ordered. \n\n"

         "Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n The State of Alaska has invoked our original jurisdiction to resolve its dispute with the United States over title to certain submerged lands underlying waters located in southeast Alaska.  Alaska initiated the action by filing a complaint with leave of the Court.  530 U.S. 1228, 147 L. Ed. 2d 272, 120 S. Ct. 2681 (2000).  We appointed Professor Gregory E. Maggs to act as Special Master in this matter.  531 U.S. 941, 148 L. Ed. 2d 271, 121 S. Ct. 337 (2000).  The Special Master gave thorough consideration to the written and oral submissions of the parties.  In a detailed report he now recommends the grant of summary judgment to the United States with respect to all the submerged lands in dispute.  Report of Special Master 1 (hereinafter Report or Special Master's Report).  We set the case for oral argument on Alaska's exceptions to the Special Master's Report.  543 U.S. ___, 543 U.S. 953, 160 L. Ed. 2d 314, 125 S. Ct. 458 (2004).  For the reasons we discuss, Alaska's exceptions are overruled. \n\nI \n\n We begin by reviewing the general principles elaborated in the resolution of similar submerged lands disputes in our earlier cases. \n\nStates enjoy a presumption of title to submerged lands beneath inland navigable waters within their boundaries and  beneath territorial waters within three nautical miles of their coasts. This presumption flows from two sources.  Under the established rule known as the equal footing doctrine, new States enter the Union \"on an 'equal footing' with the original 13 Colonies and succeed to the United States' title to the beds of navigable waters within their boundaries.\" United States v. Alaska, 521 U.S. 1, 5, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (1997)(Alaska (Arctic Coast)).Under the Submerged Lands Act (SLA), 67 Stat. 29, 43 U.S.C. § 1301 et seq., which applies to Alaska through an express provision of the Alaska Statehood Act (ASA), § 6(m), 72 Stat. 343, the presumption of state title to \"lands beneath navigable waters within the boundaries of the respective States\" is \"confirmed\" and \"established.\" 43 U.S.C. § 1311(a); see also Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 5-6, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  The SLA also \"establishes States' title to submerged lands beneath a 3-mile belt of the territorial sea, which would otherwise be held by the United States.\" Id., at 6, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  \"As a general matter, then, Alaska is entitled under both the equal footing doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act to submerged lands beneath tidal and inland navigable waters, and under  the Submerged Lands Act alone to submerged lands extending three miles seaward of its coastline.\" Ibid.\n\n The Federal Government can overcome the presumption and defeat a future State's title to submerged lands by setting them aside before statehood in a way that shows an intent to retain title.  Id., at 33-34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  The requisite intent must, however, be \"'definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.'\" Id., at 34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (quoting United States v. Holt State Bank, 270 U.S. 49, 55, 70 L. Ed. 465, 46 S. Ct. 197 (1926)). \n\nWith these principles in mind, we discuss the two areas of submerged land at issue here. \n\nII \n\n The first area of submerged land in dispute, claimed by Alaska under alternative theories in counts I and II of its  amended complaint to quiet title (hereinafter Amended Complaint), consists of pockets and enclaves of submerged lands underlying waters in between and fringing the southeastern Alaska islands known as the Alexander Archipelago.  These disputed submerged lands, shown in red and dark blue on the map in Appendix A, infra, share a common feature: All points within the pockets and enclaves are more than three nautical miles from the coast of the mainland or of any individual island of the Alexander Archipelago. \n\nFor these pockets and enclaves, the dispositive question is whether the Alexander Archipelago's waters qualify as inland waters. If they do, Alaska's coastline would begin at the outer bounds of these inland waters as marked by the black line drawn on the map in Appendix A, infra. See 43 U.S.C. § 1301(c)(\"The term 'coast line' means the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters\"); see also United States v. Alaska, 422 U.S. 184, 187-188, 45 L. Ed. 2d 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240, and n. 5 (1975)(Alaska (Cook Inlet)).Under the equal footing doctrine and the SLA, a presumption of state title would then arise as to all the submerged lands underlying both the inland waters landward of this coastline, and also the territorial sea within three nautical miles of it.  Because the United States concedes it could not rebut the presumption of state title as to this aspect of the case, Alaska would have title to all the pockets and enclaves of submerged lands in dispute. \n\nIf the Alexander Archipelago's waters do not qualify as inland, then they instead qualify as territorial sea. In that case Alaska would have no claim of title to the disputed pockets and enclaves, as these lands are beyond three nautical miles from the coast of the mainland or any individual island. \n\n The second area of submerged land in dispute, claimed by Alaska in count IV of its Amended Complaint, consists of the submerged land beneath Glacier Bay, a well-marked indentation into the coast of the southeast Alaskan mainland. See  Appendixes C, D, infra (maps of Glacier Bay).  There is no question that Glacier Bay's waters are inland. For the submerged lands underlying these waters, the controlling question is whether the United States can rebut Alaska's presumption of title. \n\n After receiving the parties' written submissions and conducting a hearing, the Special Master recommended that this Court grant summary judgment to the United States with respect to Alaska's claims of title to both areas of submerged land in dispute.  Report 1.  As to the pockets and enclaves, the Special Master concluded that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago do not qualify as inland waters either under the historic inland waters theory advanced in count I of Alaska's Amended Complaint or under the juridical bay theory advanced in count II.  Id., at 137-138, 226.  As to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay and claimed by Alaska in count IV, the Special Master concluded that the United States has rebutted the presumption that title passed to Alaska at statehood. Id., at 276.  Alaska filed exceptions to each of these three conclusions.  We address them in turn. \n\nIII \n\n In count I of its Amended Complaint, Alaska alleges that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago are historic inland waters. As this Court has recognized, \"where a State within the United States wishes to claim submerged lands based on an area's status as historic inland waters, the State must demonstrate that the United States:  (1) exercises authority over the area; (2) has done so continuously; and (3) has done so with the acquiescence of foreign nations.\" Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 11, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  \"For this showing,\" we have elaborated, \"the exercise of sovereignty must have been, historically, an assertion of power to exclude all foreign vessels and navigation.\" Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at 197, 45 L. Ed. 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240. \n\n Nations may exclude from inland waters even vessels engaged in so-called \"innocent passage\"--passage that \"is not  prejudicial to the peace, good order or security of the coastal State,\" Arts. 14(1), 14(4) of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone, Apr. 29, 1958, [1964] 15 U. S. T. 1607, 1610 T. I. A. S. No. 5639 (hereinafter Convention).  See United States v. Louisiana, 470 U.S. 93, 113, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074 (1985)(Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case);United States v. Louisiana, 394 U.S. 11, 22, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773 (1969).  To claim a body of water as historic inland water, it is therefore important to establish that the right to exclude innocent passage has somehow been asserted, even if never actually exercised.  See Alabama and Mississippi Boundary Case, 470 U.S., at 113, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074.  The Court also has considered the \"vital interests of the United States\" in designating waters as historic inland waters. Id., at 103, 84 L. Ed. 2d 73, 105 S. Ct. 1074. \n\n The Special Master recommended that the Court grant summary judgment to the United States on this count.  The Special Master first made a thorough examination of historical documents, from 1821 to the present, bearing on the status of the Alexander Archipelago's waters. The Special Master sorted these documents into five distinct periods: (1) Russian sovereignty (1821-1867), Report 23-38; (2) early American sovereignty (1867-1903), id., at 38-55; (3) the 1903 US-Britain Boundary  Arbitration, id., at 56-63; (4) later American sovereignty (1903-1959), id., at 63-89; and (5) the poststatehood era (1959-present), id., at 89-107.  Based on his examination of the record evidence from all of these periods, the Special Master concluded that \"Russia and the United States historically did not assert authority to exclude vessels from making innocent passage through the waters of the Alexander Archipelago.\" Id., at 109.  In the Special Master's view, Alaska had at best \"uncovered and presented only 'questionable evidence' that the United States exercised the kind of authority over the waters of the Archipelago that would be necessary to prove a historic waters claim.\" Id., at 129. \n\n Though Alaska's failure to demonstrate that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago had historically been treated as inland waters would by itself justify granting summary judgment to the United States on count I, the Special Master also addressed other relevant factors, such as the acquiescence of other nations and the vital interests of the United States.  In the Special Master's view these factors only strengthened the case for granting summary judgment to the United States. \n\nExcepting to the Special Master's recommendation on count I, Alaska contends the Special Master gave too little weight to historical events that tend to support Alaska's position.  By the same token Alaska argues the Special Master gave too much weight to historical events that tend to undermine its position.  Alaska also asserts that foreign nations have acquiesced in the treatment of the waters of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters, and that the interests of the United States support such treatment.  We find Alaska's arguments unconvincing. \n\n Rather than canvassing the entire historical record discussed by the Special Master in his thorough, commendable report, we turn our attention to the events Alaska presents as its best evidence that the Alexander Archipelago's waters qualify as historic inland waters. \n\nA \n\n First in time among the events to which Alaska points are incidents from the period of Russian sovereignty.  These incidents are pertinent to the inquiry because, as we have held, when Russia ceded the territory of Alaska to the United States in 1867, \"the United States thereby acquired whatever dominion Russia had possessed.\" Alaska (Cook Inlet), 422 U.S., at 192, n. 13, 45 L. Ed. 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240. \n\n In 1824, the United States and Russia entered into a treaty that, inter alia, granted United States vessels the right, over  the next 10 years, to \"frequent, without any hindrance whatever, the interior seas, gulphs, harbours, and creeks [of the Alexander Archipelago], for the purpose of fishing and trading with the natives of the country.\" See Convention Between the United States of America and Russia, Art. 4, 8 Stat. 304 (1825) (hereinafter 1824 Treaty or Treaty).  In Alaska's view this Treaty demonstrates that \"the Russian claim extended to the entire Archipelago\" and thus that Russia treated the archipelago waters as inland waters. Exceptions to Report of Special Master and Brief in Support for Plaintiff 29 (hereinafter Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska).  The principal problem with Alaska's assertion is that the 1824  Treaty by its terms did not address navigation for the purpose of innocent passage, but rather addressed only navigation \"for the purpose of fishing and trading with the natives.\" Even on the questionable assumption that the Treaty's reference to \"interior seas\" included all the waters of the Alexander Archipelago and not just waters within three nautical miles of the coast of the mainland or any particular island, but see Report 27-28 (refuting this assumption), the Treaty simply does not provide evidence that Russia asserted a right to exclude innocent passage.  Yet evidence of the assertion of this right--not some lesser right--must be provided to support an historic inland waters claim.  See Alaska (Cook Inlet), supra, at 197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 109, 95 S. Ct. 2240. \n\nUpon the expiration of the 10-year right granted to United States vessels by virtue of the 1824 Treaty, Russia stationed a brig, theChichagoff, at the southern border of Russian America.  Alaska implies that Russia's purpose in stationing the brig there was to exclude any foreign vessels from entering the Alexander Archipelago's waters. See Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 30-31.  Were we to accept this interpretation of the Chichagoff incident, we would acknowledge it as some evidence that Russia treated the Alexander Archipelago's waters as inland waters. \n\n As the Special Master noted, however, a report prepared for the 1903 Alaskan Boundary Tribunal (a tribunal we will discuss further) described the Chichagoff incident as follows: \"Governor Wrangell sent the brig Chichagoff, under command of Lieutenant Zarembo, to Tongas, near the southern boundary line at 54degree 40ft, for the purpose of intercepting foreign vessels entering the inland waters of the colony, to the masters of which he was to deliver written notice of the expiration of the treaty provisions, being furnished with six copies for American and three for British vessels.\" 1 Proceedings of the Alaskan Boundary Tribunal, S. Doc. No. 162, 58th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p 70 (1904) (hereinafter ABT proceedings) (footnote omitted).\n\nLike the Special Master, we see nothing in this passage to indicate that Russia, through its actions with respect to the Chichagoff, asserted a right to exclude from the Alexander Archipelago waters foreign vessels engaged only in innocent passage.  By giving written notice of the expiration of the 1824 Treaty rights, the Chichagoff reminded American mariners that they were no longer free to trade with the natives, or to approach within cannon shot of the Russian lands \"without any hindrance whatever.\" 1824 Treaty, Art. 4, 8 Stat. 304.  Russia did not assert thereby the more sweeping right to exclude even vessels engaged only in innocent passage. \n\nAlaska also points to evidence that in 1836 Russian forces apprehended and boarded the American vessel Loriot while it was within the Alexander Archipelago waters, and then ordered it \"'to leave the waters of His Imperial Majesty.'\" Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 30; see also Letter from John Forsyth to G. M. Dallas (May 4, 1837), reprinted in Report of Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard upon the Seal Fisheries in the Bering Sea, S. Exec. Doc. No. 106, 50th Cong., 2d Sess., 232-233 (1889).  Even this incident does  not  constitute evidence that Russia viewed the archipelago waters as inland waters, however, because the Loriot was not engaged in innocent passage.  The Loriot's mission, as freely admitted in a contemporary letter written by a State Department official to a member of the United States legation in St. Petersburg, was to visit \"the northwest coast of America, for the purpose of procuring provisions, and also Indians to hunt for sea otter on the said coast.\" Id., at 232.  By excluding the Loriot, which evidently had tried to exceed the limits of mere \"innocent passage,\" Russia did not, and could not, assert a right to exclude vessels engaged solely in innocent passage. \n\nIn sum, none of the incidents Alaska cites from the period of Russian sovereignty support the proposition that Russia treated the waters of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters prior to ceding Alaska to the United States in 1867. \n\nB \n\nFor the period of early U.S. sovereignty between 1867 and 1903, Alaska cites not a single incident demonstrating that the United States acted in a manner consistent with an understanding that the Alexander Archipelago waters were inland. Alaska thus leaves itself with at most 56 years to demonstrate continuous prestatehood treatment of the Alexander Archipelago as inland waters. This alone constitutes a substantial weakness in Alaska's position. \n\nAs to the years between 1867 and 1903, Alaska does attempt to explain away a significant event which undercuts its claim, but this attempt is unsuccessful.  In 1886, Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard wrote a letter to Secretary of Treasury Daniel Manning concerning the limits of the territorial waters of the United States on both the northeastern and the northwestern coasts. See 1 J. Moore, Digest of International Law 718-721 (1906).  The State Department's position with respect to waters surrounding fringing islands on both coasts was that the sovereigns of those islands could  only claim a territorial sea of three miles from the coast of each island. Secretary Bayard explained that, in asserting the 3-mile belt of territorial sea, the United States denied neither \"the free right of vessels of other nations to pass, on peaceful errands, through this zone\" nor the right \"of relief, when suffering from want of necessities, from the shore.\" Id., at 720-721. \n\nAccording to Secretary Bayard, the State Department's position was a well-considered one, rooted in principles of reciprocity and consistent practice: \"These rights we insist on being conceded to our fishermen in the northeast, where the mainland is under the British sceptre.  We can not refuse them to others on our northwest coast, where the sceptre is held by the United States.  We asserted them . . . against Russia, thus denying to her jurisdiction beyond three miles on her own marginal seas. We can not claim greater jurisdiction against other nations, of seas washing territories which we derived from Russia under the Alaska purchase.\" Id., at 721 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Special Master singled out this letter as \"unambiguously support[ing] the United States' position that the United States and Russia historically  did not assert the right to exclude foreign vessels from the waters of the Archipelago.\" Report 109.  Emphasizing the statements in the letter that the United States could not \"'claim greater jurisdiction'\" than three miles of marginal seas and that foreign vessels had the right to make \"'free transit,'\" the Special Master concluded that \"[o]fficials who held this belief could not, and evidently did not, claim that the United States could exclude innocent passage through the waters.\" Id., at 110. \n\nAlaska argues that Secretary Bayard's letter is of minimal relevance because \"it was internal correspondence that primarily addressed a dispute on the East coast\" and thus \"did not announce to any foreign nation that the United States had abandoned a claim to the Archipelago.\" Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 31-32.  Alaska's arguments are unpersuasive.  That Secretary Bayard's letter referred to the east coast in no way diminishes the unequivocal nature of its statements with respect to the Alaskan coast. It may be true that no foreign nation ever became aware of Secretary Bayard's letter (though the subsequent publication of the letter in the United States' Digest of International Law gives us reason to believe the contrary).  Regardless, Secretary Bayard's letter still provides strong evidence that the United States, as of 1886, did not claim a right to exclude all foreign vessels from the Alexander Archipelago waters and had no intention of doing so.  We do not need to parse the letter to see whether it \"announce[d] to any foreign nation that the United States had abandoned a claim to the Archipelago,\" for Alaska can muster no proof that the United States as of 1886 had made any such claim in the first place. \n\nC \n\nA stronger piece of evidence Alaska identifies to support its historic inland waters claim is a litigating position taken by the United States during an arbitration proceeding in 1903.  This proceeding was before the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, a body convened to resolve a dispute between the United States and Britain regarding the land boundary between southeastern Alaska and Canada.  Report 56-63, 116-119. \n\nIn a written submission to the tribunal, the United States described its view of the \"political coast\" of Alaska as enclosing all of the Alexander Archipelago waters, as shown on the map in Appendix A, infra. 4 ABT Proceedings, pt. 1, pp 31-32 (1903).  According to the United States' submissions, \"[t]he boundary of Alaska,--that is, the exterior boundary from which the marine league [of the territorial sea] is measured,--runs along the outer edge of the Alaskan or Alexander Archipelago, embracing a group composed of  hundreds of islands.\" 5 id., pt. 1, at 15-16.  At oral argument before the tribunal, moreover, counsel for the United States made explicit that the recognition of such a \"political coast\" would render all waters landward of it \"just as much interior waters as the interior waters of Loch Lomond.\" 7 id., at 611 (1904). \n\nBefore the Special Master in the instant case, the United States sought to discount as mere hypothetical statements the submissions it had made at the tribunal a full century prior.  The Special Master rejected this view and instead agreed  with Alaska that in its submissions to the tribunal the United States \"was expressing a considered analysis of the [Alexander Archipelago] area, not merely speaking hypothetically for the purpose of showing a flaw in Britain's argument.\" Report 61.  Ultimately, however, the Special Master still concluded that the United States' submissions to the tribunal were \"not an adequate assertion of authority over the waters of the Alexander Archipelago.\" Id., at 118.  The Special Master noted that the issue before the 1903 tribunal was not \"[t]he status of the waters of the Alexander Archipelago,\" ibid., but rather the land boundary between southeast Alaska and Canada; that the United States' declarations regarding the status of the Alexander Archipelago took up \"only a few paragraphs in a seven volume record\"; and that \"[f]or these reasons, it would be unrealistic to conclude that counsel's assertions at the tribunal should have made foreign nations (other than Britain) aware that the United States was asserting a right to exclude them.\" Ibid.\n\n Alaska responds that the Special Master was incorrect to conclude that the United States' submissions in 1903 could not have made foreign nations other than Britain aware of its claim.  Alaska argues that Norway became aware of the United States' submissions and then relied on them in its dispute with the United Kingdom in the well-known Fisheries Case (U. K. v. Nor.), 1951 I. C. J. 116 (Judgment of Dec. 18).  As the Special Master explained, however, \"[t]he ability  of one foreign nation to discover the United States' argument when litigating a related issue . . . does not mean that foreign nations should have known of the United States' position.\" Report 118, n 34.  This reasoning carries particular force in light of the precedent a contrary conclusion would create.  If this Court were to recognize historic inland waters claims based on arguments made by counsel during litigation about nonmaritime boundaries, \"the United States would itself become vulnerable to similarly weak claims by other nations that would restrict the freedom of the seas.\" Reply Brief for United States in Response to Exceptions of the State of Alaska 15-16 (hereinafter Reply Brief for United States).  We are reluctant to create a precedent that would have this effect. \n\nD \n\n The litigating position taken by the United States at the ABT Proceedings at best would provide weak support for inland status of the Alexander Archipelago waters even were we to accept it as signaling a significant change from the view expressed in Secretary Bayard's letter of 1886; for there is little evidence that the United States later acted in a manner consistent with this litigating position.  Alaska says that the United States asserted control over the waters by enacting and enforcing fishery regulations in the Alexander Archipelago during the first half of the 20th century.  Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 25-29.  In particular, Alaska cites the 1906 Alien Fishing Act, 34 Stat. 263, which prohibited foreign, but not domestic, commercial fishing \"in any of the waters of Alaska.\" As its sole evidence that the Act was enforced even in the pockets and enclaves at issue, Alaska cites the seizure by the United States Coast Guard in 1924 of the Canadian vessel Marguerite,  whose captain was fined $100 for fishing in contravention of the Act. \n\nAssuming, arguendo, that the Marguerite was seized in one of the disputed pockets or enclaves, a point which the Special Master found unclear, Report 67-68, this one incident  hardly suffices to demonstrate a continuous policy.  Indeed, contrary authority exists.  In 1934 the Departments of State and Commerce exchanged letters expressing their shared understanding that the United States lacked the power to enforce the Act more than three miles from the shore of any island or the mainland. Id., at 70-71 (quoting Letter from Daniel C. Roper, Secretary of Commerce, to Secretary of State 1 (Sept. 5, 1934)(\"'Canadian fishermen may operate [in the Alexander Archipelago waters] so long as they remain outside the three mile limit'\" ); and Letter from William Phillips, Under Secretary of State, to Secretary of Commerce 1 (Sept. 13, 1934) (expressing appreciation for the assurance \"'that the Fishery laws and regulations will be enforced by the Bureau of Fisheries in conformity with the view that Canadian fishermen may operate [in the Alexander Archipelago waters] so long as they remain outside the three-mile limit'\".  This understanding was inconsistent with a view of the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland. Report 70-71, 110-111. \n\nEven were the seizure of the Marguerite taken as evidence of a right asserted by the United States in 1924, the official correspondence cited by the Special Master establishes that by 1934 the United States had reverted to the position taken in Secretary Bayard's 1886 letter.  As the United States observes, furthermore, the fact that Britain protested the seizure of the Marguerite indicates that any claim of right implied from that seizure was not one in which foreign nations acquiesced.  Reply Brief for United States 17, n 10. \n\nAlaska also refers to various poststatehood events which, in its view, confirm the status of the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland waters. We find insufficient prestatehood evidence to establish inland waters status in the first place, and so we find it unnecessary to discuss these further events. \n\n At best, Alaska's submissions before this Court establish that the United States made one official statement--in the 1903 Alaska Boundary Arbitration--describing the Alexander Archipelago waters as inland, and that the United States seized one foreign vessel--the Marguerite--in a manner arguably consistent with the status of those waters as inland. These incidents are insufficient to demonstrate the continuous assertion of exclusive authority, with acquiescence of foreign nations, necessary to support an historic inland waters claim.  Alaska's exception to the Special Master's recommendation on count I of the Amended Complaint is overruled. \n\nIV \n\n In count II of its Amended Complaint, Alaska presents an alternative theory to justify treating the Alexander Archipelago's waters as inland. Alaska's alternative theory is that the waters of the Alexander Archipelago in truth consist of two vast, but as yet unnoticed, juridical bays.  Waters within a juridical bay would be deemed inland waters. Art. 5(1) of the Convention, 15 U. S. T., at 1609. Thus, if accepted, Alaska's  theory would render all the Alexander Archipelago's waters inland waters to the extent they lie within the limits of the bays Alaska identifies.  For this reason, and because the United States would not be able to rebut the presumption of title that would arise from inland waters status, Alaska's alternative theory would require the Court to accept Alaska's claim of title to the pockets and enclaves in dispute. \n\n The parties agree that Alaska's claimed juridical bays would exist only if four of the Alexander Archipelago's islands--Kuiu Island, Kupreanof Island, Mitkof Island, and Dry Island--were deemed to be connected to each other and to the mainland. We have recognized that such \"assimilat[ion]\" of islands fringing the mainland is possible, albeit only in \"exceptional case[s]\" in which \"an island or group of islands . . . 'are so integrally related to the mainland that they are realistically parts of the \"coast.\"'\" United States v. Maine, 469 U.S. 504, 517, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992 (1985) (quoting United States v. Louisiana, 394 U.S., at 66, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773).  If the assimilation Alaska urges were accepted, the four islands Alaska has identified  would form a constructive peninsula extending from the mainland and dividing the Alexander Archipelago's waters in two.  To bolster its case, Alaska labels the waters north and south of this hypothetical peninsula the \"North Bay\" and the \"South Bay.\" See Appendix B, infra (map showing Alaska's hypothetical peninsula and the resulting bays). \n\n Were we to accept Alaska's hypothetical peninsula, we would then be required to determine whether North Bay and South Bay in fact qualify as juridical bays under the Convention, which we have customarily consulted for purposes of \"determining the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters of the States.\" United States v. Maine, supra, at 513, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992.  Article 7(2) of the Convention sets forth the following geographic criteria for deciding whether a body of water qualifies as a bay: \"For the purposes of these articles, a bay is a well-marked indentation whose penetration is in such proportion to the width of its mouth as to contain landlocked waters and constitute more than a mere curvature of the coast. An indentation shall not, however, be regarded as a bay unless its area is as large as, or larger than, that of the semi-circle whose diameter is a line drawn across the mouth of that indentation.\" 15 U. S. T., at 1609.\n\nThis definition can be understood to comprise a number of elements.  To apply the definition to a given body of water, one must first determine whether the body of water satisfies the descriptive test of being a \"well-marked indentation.\" One must then determine, among other things, whether the indentation's area satisfies the mathematical \"semi-circle\" test set forth in the second sentence of Article 7(2). \n\n After due consideration of the parties' arguments, the Special Master recommended that the Court reject Alaska's alternative theory.  The Special Master first conducted a detailed assessment of the propriety of assimilating the four  islands in question in order to form the constructive peninsula so critical to Alaska's theory.  Report 147-197.  Applying  the principles set forth in United States v. Maine, supra, at 514-520, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992, and United States v. Louisiana, supra, at 60-66, 22 L. Ed. 2d 44, 89 S. Ct. 773, the Special Master concluded that assimilation would be unwarranted save for two inconsequential channels that \"do not suffice to create the juridical bays alleged by Alaska.\" Report 197.  In the alternative, the Special Master concluded that, even were Alaska's hypothetical peninsula accepted, neither \"North Bay\" nor \"South Bay\" could satisfy the descriptive test that a proposed bay constitute a \"'well-marked indentation.'\" Id., at 222. \n\nExcepting to the Special Master's recommendations, Alaska makes a detailed argument that this Court's precedents regarding assimilation of islands support recognition of the constructive peninsula Alaska has identified.  Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 39-45.  Alaska further contends that, once this peninsula is recognized, the resulting bodies of water satisfy all the criteria set forth in the Convention.  Id., at 45-49. \n\nWe overrule Alaska's exception.  For the sake of brevity we assume, arguendo, that each of the islands in Alaska's hypothetical peninsula should be assimilated one to another (though we are aware of, and Alaska itself cites, no precedent foreign or domestic in which such a massive amount of successive assimilation has been accepted for the purpose of identifying a juridical bay).  Even with the benefit of this daunting doubt Alaska could not prevail, for its hypothetical bays do not satisfy the Convention's descriptive requirement of being well-marked indentations. \n\n To qualify as a well-marked indentation, a body of water must possess physical features that would allow a mariner looking at navigational charts that do not depict bay closing lines nonetheless to perceive the bay's limits, and hence to avoid illegal encroachment into inland waters. See G. Westerman, The Juridical Bay 82-85 (1987).  Alaska's hypothetical  bays do not possess these features.  We have been referred to no authority which indicates that a mariner looking at an unadorned map of the southeast Alaskan coast has ever discerned the limits of Alaska's hypothetical bays.  So subtle are these limits that even Alaska itself did not discover them until after it had filed its first complaint in this action.  Compare Complaint to Quiet Title (Nov. 24, 1999) with Amended Complaint (Dec. 14, 2000).  The test is what mariners see, not what litigators invent.  Alaska's hypothetical bays would not be discernible to the eye of the mariner. \n\n A comparison to United States v. Maine, 469 U.S., at 514-520, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992, makes clear the force of our conclusion.  In that case the Court considered whether Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound together qualify as a juridical bay.  In determining that they do, the Court held that Long Island itself should be assimilated to the mainland. Id., at 517-520, 83 L. Ed 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992.  The Court then determined that the resulting indentation formed by Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound satisfied the requirements of Article 7(2) of the Convention, including the descriptive requirement of being a \"well-marked indentation.\" Id., at 515, 519, 83 L. Ed. 2d 998, 105 S. Ct. 992. \n\n There is a critical difference between this body of water and the bodies of water Alaska has christened as North Bay and South Bay.  Even before this Court held that Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound qualified together as a juridical bay, mariners and geographers had recognized Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound as adjacent, cohesive bodies of water--indeed, as \"sound[s],\" which itself is a term used to describe a wide and deep bay, or a strait connecting other bodies of water. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2176 (1981) (defining \"sound\" as \"a long and rather broad inlet of the ocean generally with its larger part extending roughly parallel to the coast\"; \"a long passage of water connecting two larger bodies but too wide and extensive to be termed a strait\").  Nothing of the sort can be said of Alaska's claimed bays.  It is not just that no mariner and  no geographer (and not even Alaska's litigators) before this action recognized Alaska's claimed bays as bays or sounds.  It appears that no one before this action recognized Alaska's claimed bays as constituting cohesive bodies of water at all. \n\n Even accepting the constructive peninsula Alaska has crafted out of four separate islands within the Alexander Archipelago, Alaska's claimed bays still fail to qualify as \"well-marked indentations\" for purposes of the Convention.  For this reason, we reject the alternative theory Alaska urges in count II of its Amended Complaint.  Alaska's exception to the Special Master's recommendation on this count is overruled. \n\nV \n\n In count IV of its Amended Complaint, Alaska claims title to the submerged lands underlying the waters of Glacier Bay National Monument (now known as Glacier Bay National Park), located at the northern end of the Alexander Archipelago.  Concluding that the United States had rebutted Alaska's presumed title to these lands, the Special Master recommended granting summary judgment to the United States.  As with the other aspects of this case, the Special Master was correct in his interpretation and application of the controlling precedents and principles, and we overrule Alaska's exception to his recommendation. \n\nA \n\n The centerpiece of Glacier Bay National Park is Glacier Bay itself.  By contrast to the bays Alaska claims in count II, Glacier Bay is a textbook example of a juridical bay.  Its waters mark a dramatic indentation within the coastline of the Alaskan mainland. While the width of Glacier Bay's mouth measures 5 miles at most, the bay's waters stretch more than 60 miles into the mainland. See Appendix C, infra (map of Glacier Bay). \n\nGlacier Bay National Park is one of the Nation's largest national parks, embracing over 3.2 million acres, an area  larger than the State of Connecticut.  Rennicke, North to Wild Alaska, National Geographic Traveler 48, 55 (July/Aug. 1994).  John Muir, who first saw the bay and its surroundings in 1879, described it as a \"'solitude of ice and snow and newborn rocks.'\" Id., at 56.  One way to comprehend the solitude is to note that in the area of  Glacier Bay there are still not more than 10 miles of established hiking trails.  See id., at 50.  As the world's largest marine sanctuary, it is, in one sense, a water park. \n\nA ship in the waters of the Pacific in the Gulf of Alaska reaches Glacier Bay by heading shoreward to the east through Cross Sound and to Bartlett Cove, there turning to proceed through the bay in a generally northwest direction.  See Appendix D, infra. The entrance to the bay near Bartlett Cove is about 100 miles northwest of Juneau and still 600 miles southeast of Anchorage. \n\nThe bay owes its name to Captain Beardslee of the United States Navy, who, upon first entering the bay in 1880, was so impressed by the ice formations surrounding it that he called it Glacier Bay.  5 New Encyclopaedia Britannica 290 (15th ed. 2003).  A glacier is a large formation of perennial ice.  The definition used by the Special Master was a \"'mixture of ice and rock that moves downhill over a bed of solid rock or sediment under the influence of gravity.'\" Report 246.  Some of the glaciers in the region are tidewater glaciers, so called because they end at the water's edge.  Even large ships must take precautions near these glaciers, for ice can break off (a process called calving); and when a large segment plunges to the sea, it becomes an iceberg.  Ibid.\n\nThe weight of a glacier can cause it to move, either advancing to crush the life before it or receding to allow life forms to begin anew.  At Glacier Bay some of the glaciers are advancing, some are receding, and others seem to be stable.  See id., at 246-247. \n\nAt least in Glacier Bay, the extreme slowness suggested by the term \"glacial\" is inapt, for the ice once present where  the bay now extends receded with (in a geological context) astounding speed.  When Captain George Vancouver visited in 1794, the bay was but 5 miles inward from Bartlett Cove, while today it penetrates inland for over 60 miles. This retreat of the ice is \"considered the fastest glacial withdrawal in recorded history.  'Unzipping,' the geologists call it.  The landscape dancing in geologic time.\" Rennicke, supra, at 56.  The advance and retreat of the glaciers are of great interest to scientists, and in the areas of glacial recession the submerged floor of the bay is contoured or sculptured in ways that can be studied to learn more of glacial movement and geologic formations.  See Report 246-248. \n\nThe immense scene is one of remarkable beauty, and the waters, which accommodate large vessels, can be calm enough so that kayaks can be used to explore the bay and its surroundings.  Where glaciers have retreated either in the bay or on shore, the retreat reveals how a new life cycle begins.  Plant succession is of absorbing interest.  \"It can be almost like a chant: lichens and algae, moss and dryas, fireweed, willows, alder, and spruce.\" Rennicke, supra, at 56. \n\nThe bay and the surrounding shore and forest areas of the park sustain a chain of fish, bird, and animal life.  Over 200 avian species have been noted, most of these in or near the marine environment.  Glacier Bay: A Guide to Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska 78 (1983).  There are mussels and crabs on the shore, and in the bay's waters there are numerous fish, including herring  and salmon.  The light in the long days of summer, and the oxygen-rich waters, accelerate phytoplankton populations, and this is part of the food chain working up to the herring and salmon, then porpoises, seals, and sea lions.  The bay also has whales, including the humpback whale.  K. Jettmar, Alaska's Glacier Bay: A Traveler's Guide 53 (1997). \n\nIn the 1930's, when naturalists and other observers were supporting the movement to expand Glacier Bay National  Monument beyond its initial boundaries, the brown bear became the flagship species for the cause.  Declaration of Theodore R. Catton 51, Exhibits to Reply of United States in Support of Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Count IV of Amended Complaint, Tab No. 3 (Exh. U.S. IV-3).  One of the largest of omnivores, the brown bear's food in estuarine areas includes \"vegetation, invertebrates (clams, mussels, worms, barnacles, amphipods), carcasses of fish and marine mammals washed onto the beach, and winter-killed ungulates . . . .\" Declaration of Victor Barnes 3 (Exh. U.S. IV-6).  Brown bears find salmon in streams, and (with distressing frequency) they can swim to the small islands to raid the nesting places of birds and water fowl.  Id., at 9.  When bears swim in the bay, they are particularly vulnerable to hunters.  When he was considering the proposal to extend the boundaries of the Glacier Bay National Monument, President Franklin Roosevelt was angered by accounts of bears being shot from pleasure yachts.  Id., at 16. \n\n Reference to the complex ecosystem of Glacier Bay and the surrounding land is important for understanding the purposes that led the United States to create Glacier Bay National Monument. These purposes, in turn, inform the inquiry whether title to the submerged land underlying the waters of Glacier Bay National Monument passed to Alaska at statehood. See Idaho v. United States, 533 U.S. 262, 274, 150 L. Ed. 2d 326, 121 S. Ct. 2135 (2001) (describing the inquiry as encompassing the question whether \"the purpose of the reservation would have been compromised if the submerged lands had passed to the State\"); Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 42-43, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (noting that \"defeating state title . . . was necessary to achieve the United States' objective [of] securing a supply of oil and gas that would necessarily exist beneath uplands and submerged lands\"). \n\nB \n\n Owing to Glacier Bay's status as a juridical bay, its waters qualify as inland navigable waters. All the remaining waters  within the boundaries of Glacier Bay National Monument as it existed at statehood, moreover, lie less than three nautical miles from the coastline.  Under both the equal footing doctrine and the SLA, therefore, a strong presumption arises that title to the lands underlying all the waters in dispute in count IV of Alaska's Amended Complaint passed to Alaska at statehood. See supra, at 545 U.S. 75, 125 S. Ct. 2137, 162 L. Ed. 2d, 57, 69, 70; see also Alaska (Arctic Coast), supra, at 33-36, 138 L. Ed. 2d 213, 117 S. Ct. 1888.The controlling question here is whether the United States can rebut this presumption. \n\n It is now settled that the United States can defeat a future  State's presumed title to submerged lands not only by conveyance to third parties but also by setting submerged lands aside as part of a federal reservation \"such as a wildlife refuge.\" Idaho v. United States, supra, at 273, 150 L. Ed. 2d 326, 121 S. Ct. 2135; Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 33-34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  To ascertain whether Congress has made use of that power, we conduct a two-step inquiry.  We first inquire whether the United States clearly intended to include submerged lands within the reservation. If the answer is yes, we next inquire whether the United States expressed its intent to retain federal title to submerged lands within the reservation. Id., at 36, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888; Idaho v. United States, supra, at 273, 150 L. Ed. 2d 326, 121 S. Ct. 2135.  \"We will not infer an intent to defeat a future State's title to inland submerged lands 'unless the intention was definitely declared or otherwise made very plain.'\" Alaska (Arctic Coast), supra, at 34, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. (quoting Holt State Bank, 270 U.S., at 55, 70 L. Ed. 465, 46 S. Ct. 197). \n\n After careful consideration of the parties' arguments, the Special Master recommended granting summary judgment to the United States on Alaska's claim of title to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay.  Report 227-276.  His recommendation rested on two conclusions that track the two-part test developed in our precedents.  First, he concluded that in creating Glacier Bay National Monument the United States had reserved the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay and the remaining waters within the monument's boundaries.  Id., at 264.  Second, he concluded that § 6(e) of the ASA, 72 Stat. 340-341, note preceding 48 U.S.C. § 21, p 320, expressed Congressional intent to retain those submerged lands in federal ownership.  Report 276. \n\nAlaska takes exception only to the Special Master's second conclusion.  We nonetheless explain the Special Master's first conclusion (and our own), for it is a necessary part of the reasoning for the second step of the analysis. \n\nC \n\nWe need not detain ourselves long with the first part of the test regarding title to submerged lands.  In 1925, President Calvin Coolidge invoked the Antiquities Act of 1906, ch. 3060, 34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. § 431 et seq., to create Glacier Bay National Monument. Proclamation No. 1733,43 Stat. 1988(1925 Proclamation).  In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a proclamation expanding the monument to include all of Glacier Bay's waters and to extend the monument's western boundary three nautical miles out to sea. Proclamation No. 2330, 3 CFR 28 (Supp. 1939) (1939 Proclamation).  See Appendix C, infra (depicting both the initial boundaries established by the 1925 Proclamation and the expanded boundaries established by the 1939 Proclamation).  In 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued a proclamation slightly altering the monument's boundaries, but leaving the bay's waters within them.  Proclamation No. 3089, 3 CFR 24 (Supp. 1955) (1955 Proclamation).  In 1980, Congress designated the monument as part of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and expanded the resulting reservation's boundaries.  16 U.S.C. § 410hh-2; see Appendix D, infra (map of Glacier Bay National Park).  For present purposes, however, the important point is that by the time Alaska achieved statehood in 1959, the Glacier Bay National Monument had already existed for 34 years as a federal reservation. \n\nAfter considering the evidence submitted by both parties, the Special Master concluded that \"the Glacier Bay National  Monument, as it existed at the time of statehood, clearly included the submerged lands within its boundaries.\" Report 263-264.  According to the Special Master, the descriptions of the monument in the 1925, 1939, and 1955 Proclamations themselves showed that the monument embraced submerged lands.  Id., at 232-242.  The Special Master also considered it significant that exclusion of the submerged lands would have undermined at least three of the purposes that led the United States to create Glacier Bay National Monument. Exclusion of the submerged lands would impair scientific study of the majestic tidewater glaciers surrounding the bay.  Id., at 245-251.  It would also impair efforts both to study and to preserve the remnants of \"'interglacial forests,'\" which can be found both above and below the tideline.  Id., at 251-253.  Finally, exclusion of the submerged lands would compromise the goal of safeguarding the flora and fauna that thrive in Glacier Bay's complex and interdependent ecosystem.  Id., at 253-263. \n\nThe Special Master, in our view, had ample support for his conclusions that all of these were purposes for creation of the monument, and each would be compromised were it to be determined that submerged lands were not included in the monument. His ultimate determination, that Glacier Bay National Monument included the submerged lands within its boundaries, has strong support in the precedents and in the whole record of the case.  Alaska has not filed a formal exception to this determination, and the four-sentence footnote in Alaska's brief which expresses disagreement with it, Exceptions and Brief for Plaintiff Alaska 10-11, n 4, does not in our view suffice to impeach its validity. \n\nD \n\nHaving established the proposition that the Glacier Bay National Monument, at the time of Alaska's statehood, included the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay, we turn to the remaining question: whether the United States \"'definitely declared or otherwise made very plain'\" its intent to defeat Alaska's title to these submerged lands.  Alaska (Arctic Coast), 521 U.S., at 34, 138 L. Ed. 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (quoting Holt State Bank, 270 U.S., at 55, 70 L. Ed. 465, 46 S. Ct. 197). \n\n1 \n\n The requisite expression of intent might conceivably reside in the very proclamations that invoked the Antiquities Act of 1906 to create and then expand Glacier Bay National Monument. It is clear, after all, that the Antiquities Act empowers the President to reserve submerged lands.  United States v. California, 436 U.S. 32, 36, 56 L. Ed. 2d 94, 98 S. Ct. 1662 (1978). An essential purpose of monuments created pursuant to the Antiquities Act, furthermore, is \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such  means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" 16 U.S.C. § 1.  From these two premises it would require little additional effort to reach a holding that the Antiquities Act itself delegated to the President sufficient power not only to reserve submerged lands but also to defeat a future State's title to them.  Given the reasons motivating the creation of Glacier Bay National Monument and the overall complexity of the Glacier Bay ecosystem, it would be unsurprising to find that the relevant proclamations manifested intent to retain federal title. \n\nOne amicus has advanced this argument at length, and the United States foreshadows it in a footnote.  See Brief for National Parks Conservation Association as Amicus Curiae 6-7, 13-16; Reply Brief for United States 32, n 20.  If true, this argument would provide a powerful alternative basis for agreeing with the Special Master's recommendation to grant summary judgment to the United States with respect to Alaska's claim of title to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay. \n\n We need pursue this alternative basis no further, however.  In our view the provisions of the ASA themselves suffice to  overcome the state ownership presumption arising from the equal footing doctrine and the SLA and to reserve the submerged lands in Glacier Bay to the United States. \n\n2 \n\n The Special Master agreed with the United States that Congress expressed an intent to retain title to all of Glacier Bay National Monument, including the submerged lands within it, in § 6(e) of the ASA.  Report 276.  To understand § 6(e), we begin by considering its context within the ASA, its text, and the construction we have given to it in an earlier case. \n\nSection 5 of the ASA sets forth a guiding principle regarding title to property within Alaska's boundaries: \"TheState of Alaska and its political subdivisions, respectively, shall have and retain title to all property, real and personal,  title to which is in the Territory of Alaska or any of the subdivisions.  Except as provided in section 6 hereof, the United States shall retain title to all property, real and personal, to which it has title, including public lands.\" 72 Stat. 340.\n\nBased on this provision, the new State of Alaska acquired title to any property previously belonging to the Territory of Alaska.  The United States, in turn, retained title to its property located within Alaska's borders, \"including public lands,\" subject to certain exceptions set forth in § 6 of the ASA. \n\nOne of those exceptions is contained in § 6(e), which provides in pertinent part: \"All real and personal property of the United States situated in the Territory of Alaska which is specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska, under the provisions of the Alaska game law of July 1, 1943 (57 Stat. 301; 48 U.S.C., secs. 192-211), as amended, and under  the provisions of the Alaska commercial fisheries laws of June 26, 1906 (34 Stat. 478; 48 U.S.C., secs. 230-239 and 241-242), and June 6, 1924 (43 Stat. 465; 48 U.S.C., secs. 221-228), as supplemented and  amended, shall be transferred and conveyed to the State of Alaska by the appropriate Federal agency: . . . Provided, That such transfer shall not include lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife nor facilities utilized in connection therewith, or in connection with general research activities relating to fisheries or wildlife.\" Id., at 340-341.\n\nThe first quoted part of § 6(e), the initial clause, directs a transfer to Alaska of any federal property located in Alaska and used \"for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska\" under three particular federal game and wildlife laws.  The next quoted part, the proviso, makes clear that the transfer directive in the initial clause has no application to \"lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife.\" \n\nIn Alaska (Arctic Coast), we held that the proviso of § 6(e) expressed congressional intent to retain title to a reservation such as the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), and that the statute's declaration of intent was sufficient to defeat Alaska's presumed title under both the equal footing doctrine and the SLA.  \"In § 6(e) of the ASA, Congress clearly contemplated continued federal ownership of certain submerged lands--both inland submerged lands and submerged lands beneath the territorial sea--so long as those submerged lands were among those 'withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife.'\" 521 U.S., at 56-57, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (quoting § 6(e)).  If the proviso of § 6(e) applies to Glacier Bay National Monument, as we held it applied to ANWR in Alaska (Arctic Coast), then it follows that title to the submerged lands underlying Glacier Bay did not pass to Alaska at statehood. \n\n To avoid this reasoning, Alaska first argues that the proviso is limited in scope to federal property already covered by the initial clause; because Glacier Bay is not covered by the initial clause, the State contends, it is not covered by the proviso either.  Alaska next argues that even assuming the scope of the proviso is broader than the initial clause,  Glacier Bay was not \"set apart\" \"for the protection of wildlife.\" We reject both of Alaska's arguments. \n\na \n\nRegarding the relationship between the initial clause and the proviso, Alaska contends the proviso applies only to wildlife refuges or reservations set aside under the three particular federal game and wildlife statutes named in the initial clause.  Glacier Bay National Monument was not set aside under any of these particular statutes, of course; so Alaska says that omission from the initial clause dictates omission from the proviso. The United States counters that the initial clause is confined to specific property but that the proviso is a statement of intent to retain federal title which extends to all reservations thus described without regard to the specific statutory authority under which the reservations were set aside. \n\n As the Special Master noted, generalizations about the relationship between a proviso and a preceding clause prove to be of little help in resolving the parties' disagreement about the scope of § 6(e)'s  proviso. Report 268.  Though it may be customary to use a proviso to refer only to things covered by a preceding clause, it is also possible to use a proviso to state a general, independent rule.  \"[A] proviso is not always limited in its effect to the part of the enactment with which it is immediately associated; it may apply generally to all cases within the meaning of the language used.\" McDonald v. United States, 279 U.S. 12, 21, 73 L. Ed. 582, 49 S. Ct. 218 (1929); see also 2A N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 47:08, p 238 (2000). \n\n We conclude that Alaska's narrow reading of the proviso is neither necessary nor preferred.  Section 6(e) begins with specificity.  It covers \"all real and personal property\" \"specifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protection of the fisheries and wildlife of Alaska\" as identified under three particular federal game and wildlife laws.  Those provisions, in turn, make clear that the initial clause's transfer requirement applies to facilities such as certain fish hatcheries, and likely would include specific types of equipment or even vehicles. \n\nHaving thus transferred the identified \"property,\" the section proceeds to state a more general reservation, using the word \"lands.\" \"Provided, [t]hat such transfer shall not include lands withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife nor facilities . . . .\" The lands here in question were in fact \"withdrawn or otherwise set apart,\" that is to say by the proclamations which created the monument. Though it may not be the usual style, it does not strike us as illogical for the draftsperson of a statute to write it so that it transfers some specific real and personal property and then proceeds to reserve lands in a much larger classification. \n\nAlaska's insistence that the proviso must be limited to what is contained at the outset is foreclosed as well by the decision in Alaska (Arctic Coast). In the proceedings leading up to that decision, Alaska had argued that § 6(e)'s proviso did nothing more than to except lands from the transfer effected in § 6(e)'s initial clause.  In Alaska's view, even lands covered by the proviso could still be transferred by virtue of the SLA made applicable to Alaska via § 6(m) of the ASA.  See Reply Brief for State of Alaska in United States v. Alaska, O. T. 1996, No. 84, Orig., pp 44-45. The Court rejected Alaska's view: \"If [the Arctic National Wildlife Range is covered by §6(e)'s proviso], then the United States retained title to submerged lands as well as uplands within the Range.  This is so despite § 6(m) of the Statehood Act, which applied the Submerged Lands Act of 1953 to Alaska.  The Submerged Lands Act operated to confirm Alaska's title to equal footing lands and to transfer title to submerged lands beneath the territorial sea to Alaska at statehood, unless the United States clearly withheld submerged lands within either category prior to statehood. In § 6(e) of the Statehood Act, Congress clearly contemplated continued federal ownership of certain submerged lands--both inland submerged lands and submerged lands beneath the territorial sea--so long as those submerged lands were among those 'withdrawn or otherwise set apart as refuges or reservations for the protection of wildlife.'\" 521 U.S., at 56-57,  138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888 (emphasis in original).\n\nThus we have held that § 6(e)'s proviso operates not just negatively and parasitically, only to except refuges or reservations \"set apart\" for \"the protection of wildlife\" from the transfer effected by § 6(e)'s main clause, but also affirmatively and independently, as an expression of Congress' intent to retain federal ownership over all lands within such reservations. \n\nThis affirmative and independent expression of intent logically applies with just as much force to reservations that fall within § 6(e)'s initial clause as to those that do not.  It would have made little sense for Congress to differentiate between those two sets of reservations in making the broad statement of intent we have construed § 6(e)'s proviso to set forth.  It would have made even less sense to differentiate in such a way as to exclude reservations set aside pursuant to the Antiquities Act, like Glacier Bay National Monument. The differentiation suggested by Alaska's reading, moreover, cannot be discerned from the text of § 6(e)'s proviso, which covers all reservations set aside \"for the protection of wildlife,\" regardless of the specific authority under which those reservations were set aside. \n\n Alaska is correct to note that our decision in Alaska (Arctic Coast) did not directly address the relationship between the initial clause and the proviso in § 6(e).  As Alaska observes, it appears that we assumed the ANWR would fall within § 6(e)'s initial clause were it not for the proviso. Id., at 60-61, 138 L. Ed. 2d 231, 117 S. Ct. 1888.  For the reasons we have explained,  however, the broad construction we gave to the proviso in Alaska (Arctic Coast) of necessity carries consequences for the relationship between it and the initial clause. \n\nb \n\nAnticipating the possibility that its narrow interpretation of the proviso might be rejected, Alaska raises one last argument.  The proviso does not reach Glacier Bay even under a broad view of the proviso's scope, Alaska contends, because Glacier Bay was not set apart \"for the protection of wildlife\" within the meaning of § 6(e). \n\nThis argument can be rejected without extended discussion.  As the Special Master noted and as we have recognized, Congress has made clear that one of the fundamental purposes of wildlife reservations set apart pursuant to the Antiquities Act is \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\" 16 U.S.C. § 1.  Because Glacier Bay National Monument serves as habitat for many forms of wildlife, it was set aside in part for its preservation.  Any doubt as to this conclusion is dispelled by reference to the Presidential proclamations setting aside the monument, for the proclamations identify the study of flora and fauna as one of the express purposes of the reservation. 1925 Proclamation, 43 Stat. 1988; 1939 Proclamation, 3 CFR 28 (Supp. 1939).  As the Special Master observed, the study of flora and fauna necessarily requires their preservation.  Report 274. \n\n In sum we agree with the United States that the proviso is best read, in light of our prior interpretation of it in Alaska (Arctic Coast), as expressing an independent and general rule uncoupled from the initial clause.  Under the initial clause the United States obligated itself to transfer to Alaska equipment and other property used for general fish and wildlife management responsibilities Alaska was to undertake upon acquiring statehood. Under the proviso the United States expressed its intent, notwithstanding this property transfer, to retain ownership over all federal refuges and reservations set aside for the protection of wildlife, regardless of the specific statutory authority enabling the set-aside.  This expression of intent encompassed Glacier Bay National Monument, which was set aside \"for the protection of wildlife\" within the meaning of § 6(e).  The text thus defeated the presumption that the new State of Alaska would acquire title to the submerged lands underlying the monument's waters, including the inland waters of Glacier Bay. \n\nAlaska's exception to the Special Master's recommendation on count IV of Alaska's Amended Complaint is overruled. \n\nVI \n\n For the foregoing reasons, we overrule each of Alaska's exceptions to the Special Master's recommendations.  Alaska shall take title neither to the submerged lands underlying the pockets and enclaves of water at issue in counts I and II of its Amended Complaint nor to the submerged lands underlying the waters of Glacier Bay at issue in count IV.  As to Count III of Alaska's Amended Complaint, the parties and the Special Master are in agreement that this Court should confirm the United States' proposed disclaimer of title.  The proposed disclaimer is hereby accepted. \n\nThe parties are directed to prepare and submit to the Special Master an appropriate proposed decree for the Court's consideration.  The Court retains jurisdiction to entertain  such proceedings, enter such orders, and issue such writs as may become necessary or advisable to effect and supplement the forthcoming decree and the respective rights of the parties. \n\nIt is so ordered.

         "Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court. \n\n This case involves the process by which Ohio classifies prisoners for placement at its highest security prison, known as a \"Supermax\" facility.  Supermax facilities are maximum-security prisons with highly restrictive conditions, designed to segregate the most dangerous prisoners from the general prison population.  We must consider what process the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires Ohio to afford to inmates before assigning them to Supermax.  We hold that the procedures Ohio has adopted provide sufficient procedural protection to comply with due process requirements. \n\nI \n\nThe use of Supermax prisons has increased over the last 20 years, in part as a response to the rise in prison gangs and prison violence.  See generally U. S. Dept. of Justice, National Institute of Corrections, C. Riveland, Supermax Prisons: Overview and General Considerations 1 (1999), http://www.nicic.org/pubs/1999/014937.pdf (as visited June 29, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court's case file).  About 30 States now operate Supermax prisons, in addition to the two operated by the Federal Government.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 2.  In 1998, Ohio opened its only Supermax facility, the Ohio State Penitentiary (OSP), after a riot in one of its maximum-security prisons. OSP has the capacity to house up to 504 inmates in single-inmate cells and is designed to \"'separate the most predatory and dangerous prisoners from the rest of the . . . general [prison] population.'\" See 189 F. Supp. 2d 719, 723 (ND Ohio 2002)(Austin I) (quoting deposition of R. Wilkinson, pp 24-25). \n\nConditions at OSP are more restrictive than any other form of incarceration in Ohio, including conditions on its death row or in its administrative control units.  The latter are themselves a highly restrictive form of solitary confinement. See Austin I, supra, 724-725, and n 5 (citing Ohio Admin.  Code § 5120-9-13 (2001) (rescinded 2004)).  In OSP almost every aspect of an inmate's life is controlled and monitored.  Inmates must remain in their cells, which measure 7 by 14 feet, for 23 hours per day.  A light remains on in the cell at all times, though it is sometimes dimmed, and an inmate who attempts to shield the light to sleep is subject to further discipline.  During the one hour per day that an inmate may leave his cell, access is limited to one of two indoor recreation cells. \n\nIncarceration at OSP is synonymous with extreme isolation.  In contrast to any other Ohio prison, including any segregation unit, OSP cells have solid metal doors with metal strips along their sides and bottoms which prevent conversation or communication with other inmates. All meals are taken alone in the inmate's cell instead of in a common eating area.  Opportunities for visitation are rare and in all events are conducted through glass walls.  It is fair to say OSP inmates are deprived of almost any environmental or sensory stimuli and of almost all human contact. \n\nAside from the severity of the conditions,  placement at OSP is for an indefinite period of time, limited only by an  inmate's sentence. For an inmate serving a life sentence, there is no indication how long he may be incarcerated at OSP once assigned there.  Austin I, supra, at 740.  Inmates otherwise eligible for parole lose their eligibility while incarcerated at OSP.  189 F. Supp. 2d, at 728. \n\nPlacement at OSP is determined in the following manner: Upon entering the prison system, all Ohio inmates are assigned a numerical security classification from level 1 through level 5, with 1 the lowest security risk and 5 the highest.  See Brief for Petitioners 7.  The initial security classification is based on numerous factors (e.g., the nature of the underlying offense, criminal history, or gang affiliation) but is subject to modification at any time during the inmate's prison term if, for instance, he engages in misconduct or is deemed a security risk.  Ibid. Level 5 inmates are placed in OSP, and levels 1 through 4 inmates are placed at lower security facilities throughout the State.  Ibid.\n\nOhio concedes that when OSP first became operational, the procedures used to assign inmates to the facility were inconsistent and undefined.  For a time, no official policy governing placement was in effect.  See Austin I, supra, at 726-727.  Haphazard placements were not uncommon, and some individuals who did not pose high-security risks were designated, nonetheless, for OSP.  In an effort to establish guidelines for the selection and classification of inmates suitable for OSP, Ohio issued Department of Rehabilitation and Correction Policy 111-07 (Aug. 31, 1998).  This policy has been revised at various points but relevant here are two versions: the \"Old Policy\" and the \"New Policy.\" The Old Policy took effect on January 28, 1999, but problems with assignment appear to have persisted even under this written set of standards.  189 F. Supp. 2d, at 728-736.  After forming a committee to study the matter and retaining a national expert in prison security, Ohio promulgated the New Policy in early 2002.  The New Policy provided more guidance regarding the factors to be considered in placement decisions and afforded inmates more procedural protection against erroneous placement at OSP. \n\n Although the record is not altogether clear regarding the precise manner in which the New Policy operates, we construe it based on the policy's text, the accompanying forms, and the parties' representations at oral argument and in their briefs.  The New Policy appears to operate as follows: A classification review for OSP placement can occur either (1) upon entry into the prison system if the inmate was convicted of certain offenses, e.g., organized crime, or (2) during the term of incarceration if an inmate engages in specified conduct, e.g., leads a prison gang. App. 42-43.  The review process begins when a prison official prepares a \"Security Designation Long Form\" (Long Form).  Id., at 20.  This three-page form details matters such as the inmate's recent violence, escape attempts, gang affiliation, underlying offense, and other pertinent details.  Id., at 20, 38-45. \n\nA three-member Classification Committee (Committee) convenes to review the proposed classification and to hold a hearing.  At least 48 hours before the hearing, the inmate is provided with written notice summarizing the conduct or offense triggering  the review.  Id., at 22, 58.  At the time of notice, the inmate also has access to the Long Form, which details why the review was initiated.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-17.  The inmate may attend the hearing, may \"offer any pertinent information, explanation and/or objections to [OSP] placement,\" and may submit a written statement.  App. 22.  He may not call witnesses. \n\nIf the Committee does not recommend OSP placement, the process terminates. Id., at 62, 65.  See also Brief for Petitioners 9.  If the Committee does recommend OSP placement, it documents the decision on a \"Classification Committee Report\" (CCR), setting forth \"the nature of the threat the inmate presents and the committee's reasons for the recommendation,\" App. 64, as well as a summary of any information  presented at the hearing.  Id., at 59-65.  The Committee sends the completed CCR to the warden of the prison where the inmate is housed or, in the case of an inmate just entering the prison system, to another designated official.  Id., at 23. \n\nIf, after reviewing the CCR, the warden (or the designated official) disagrees and concludes that OSP is inappropriate, the process terminates and the inmate is not placed in OSP.  If the warden agrees, he indicates his approval on the CCR, provides his reasons, and forwards the annotated CCR to the Bureau of Classification (Bureau) for a final decision.  Id., at 64.  (The Bureau is a body of Ohio prison officials vested with final decisionmaking authority over all Ohio inmate assignments.) The annotated CCR is served upon the inmate, notifying him of the Classification Committee's and warden's recommendations and reasons.  Id., at 65.  The inmate has 15 days to file any objections with the Bureau of Classification. Ibid.\n\nAfter the 15-day period, the Bureau of Classification reviews the CCR and makes a final determination.  If it concludes OSP placement is inappropriate, the process terminates. If the Bureau approves the warden's recommendation, the inmate is transferred to OSP.  The Bureau's chief notes the reasons for the decision on the CCR, and the CCR is again provided to the inmate. Ibid.\n\nInmates assigned to OSP receive another review within 30 days of their arrival.  That review is conducted by a designated OSP staff member, who examines the inmate's file.  Id., at 25.  If the OSP staff member deems the inmate inappropriately placed, he prepares a written recommendation to the OSP warden that the inmate be transferred to a lower security institution.  Brief for Petitioners 9; App. 25.  If the OSP warden concurs, he forwards that transfer recommendation to the Bureau of Classification for appropriate action.  If the inmate is deemed properly placed, he remains in OSP and his placement is reviewed on at least an annual basis according to the initial three-tier classification review process outlined above.  Brief for Petitioners 9-10. \n\n II \n\n This action began when a class of current and former OSP inmates brought suit under Rev. Stat. § 1979, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio against various Ohio prison officials.  We refer to the class of plaintiff inmates, respondents here, collectively as \"the inmates.\"  We refer to the prison officials, petitioners here, as \"Ohio.\" \n\nThe inmates' complaint alleged that Ohio's Old Policy, which was in effect at the time the suit was brought, violated due process.  In addition the inmates brought a claim that certain conditions at OSP violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishments, but that claim was settled in the District Court.  The extent to which the settlement resolved the practices that were the subject of the inmates' Eighth Amendment claim is unclear but, in any event, that issue is not before us.  The inmates' suit sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  On the eve of trial Ohio promulgated its New Policy and represented that it contained the procedures to be followed in the future.  The District Court and Court of Appeals evaluated the adequacy of the New Policy, and it therefore forms the basis for our determination here. \n\nAfter an 8-day trial with extensive evidence, including testimony from expert witnesses, the District Court made findings and conclusions and issued a detailed remedial order.  First, relying on this Court's decision in Sandin v. Conner,515 U.S. 472, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (1995), the District Court found that the inmates have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment to OSP.  Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 738-740.  Second, the District Court found Ohio had denied the inmates due process by failing to afford a large number of them notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard before transfer; failing to give inmates sufficient notice of the grounds serving as the basis for their retention at OSP; and failing to give the inmates sufficient opportunity to understand the reasoning and evidence  used to retain them at OSP.  Id., at 749.  Third, the District Court held that, although Ohio's New Policy provided more procedural safeguards than its Old Policy, it was nonetheless inadequate to meet procedural due process requirements.  Id., at 736, 750-754.  In a separate order it directed extensive modifications to that policy.  204 F. Supp. 2d 1024 (ND Ohio 2002). \n\nThe modifications the District Court ordered to Ohio's New Policy included both substantive and procedural reforms.  The former narrowed the grounds that Ohio could consider in recommending assignment to OSP.  For instance, possession of drugs in small amounts, according to the District Court, could not serve as the basis for an OSP assignment.  Id., at 1028.  The following are some of the procedural modifications the District Court ordered: \n\n(1) Finding that the notice provisions of Ohio's New Policy were inadequate, the District Court ordered Ohio to provide the inmates with an exhaustive list of grounds believed to justify placement at OSP and a summary of all evidence upon which the Classification Committee would rely.  Matters not so identified, the District Court ordered, could not be considered by the Committee.  Id., at 1026. \n\n(2) The District Court supplemented the inmate's opportunity to appear before the Committee and to make an oral or written statement by ordering Ohio to allow inmates to present documentary evidence and call witnesses before the Committee, provided that doing so would not be unduly hazardous or burdensome.  The District Court further ordered that Ohio must attempt to secure the  participation of any witness housed within the prison system. Id., at 1026-1027. \n\n(3) Finding the New Policy's provision of a brief statement of reasons for a recommendation of OSP placement inadequate, the District Court ordered the Classification Committee to summarize all evidence supporting its recommendation. Id., at 1027.  Likewise, the District Court ordered the Bureau of Classification to prepare a \"detailed and specific\" statement \"set[ting] out all grounds\" justifying OSP placement including \"facts relied upon and reasoning used.\" Id., at 1027.  The statement shall \"not use conclusory,\" \"vague,\" or \"boilerplate language,\" and must be delivered to the inmate within five days.  Id., at 1027-1028. \n\n(4) The District Court supplemented the New Policy's 30-day and annual review processes, ordering Ohio to notify the inmate twice per year both in writing and orally of his progress toward a security level reduction.  Specifically, that notice must \"advise the inmate what specific conduct is necessary for that prisoner to be reduced from Level 5 and the amount of time it will take before [Ohio] reduces the inmate's security level classification.\" Ibid.\n\nOhio appealed.  First, it maintained that the inmates lacked a constitutionally protected liberty interest in avoiding placement at OSP.  Second, it argued that, even assuming a liberty interest, its New Policy provides constitutionally adequate procedures and thus the District Court's modifications were unnecessary.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's conclusion that the inmates had a liberty interest in avoiding placement at OSP.  372 F.3d 346, 356 (2004).  The Court of Appeals also affirmed the District Court's procedural modifications in their entirety.  Id., at 359-360.  Finally, it set aside the District Court's far-reaching substantive modifications, concluding they exceeded the scope of the District Court's authority.  This last aspect of the Court of Appeals' ruling is not the subject of review in this Court. \n\n We granted certiorari to consider what process an inmate must be afforded under the Due Process Clause when he is considered for placement at OSP.   543 U.S. ___, 543 U.S. 1032, 160 L. Ed. 2d 518, 125 S. Ct. 686 (2004).  For reasons discussed below, we conclude that the inmates have a protected liberty interest in avoiding assignment at OSP.  We further hold that the procedures set forth in the New Policy are sufficient to satisfy the Constitution's requirements; it follows, then, that the procedural modifications  ordered by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals were in error. \n\nIII \n\nWithdrawing from the position taken in the Court of Appeals, Ohio in its briefs to this Court conceded that the inmates have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment at OSP.  See Pet. for Cert. i; Brief for Petitioners i.  The United States, supporting Ohio as amicus curiae, disagrees with Ohio's concession and argues that the inmates have no liberty interest in avoiding assignment to a prison facility with more restrictive conditions of confinement. See Brief for United States 10.  At oral argument Ohio initially adhered to its earlier concession, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, but when pressed, the State backtracked.  See id., at 6-7.  We need  reach the question of what process is due only if the inmates establish a constitutionally protected liberty interest, so it is appropriate to address this threshold question at the outset. \n\n The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects persons against deprivations of life, liberty, or property; and those who seek to invoke its procedural protection must establish that one of these interests is at stake.  A liberty interest may arise from the Constitution itself, by reason of guarantees implicit in the word \"liberty,\" see, e.g., Vitek v. Jones,445 U.S. 480, 493-494, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552, 100 S. Ct. 1254 (1980) (liberty interest in avoiding involuntary psychiatric treatment and transfer to mental institution), or it may arise from an expectation or interest created by state laws or policies, see, e.g., Wolff v. McDonnell,418 U.S. 539, 556-558, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963 (1974) (liberty interest in avoiding withdrawal of state-created system of good-time credits). \n\nWe have held that the Constitution itself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of confinement. Meachum v. Fano,427 U.S. 215, 225, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451, 96 S. Ct. 2532 (1976) (no liberty interest arising from Due Process Clause itself in transfer from low- to maximum-security  prison because \"[c]onfinement in any of the State's institutions is within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose\").  We have also held, however, that a liberty interest in avoiding particular conditions of confinement may arise from state policies or regulations, subject to the important limitations set forth in Sandin v. Conner,515 U.S. 472, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (1995). \n\nSandin involved prisoners' claims to procedural due process protection before placement in segregated confinement for 30 days, imposed as discipline for disruptive behavior. Sandin observed that some of our earlier cases, Hewitt v. Helms,459 U.S. 460, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 864 (1983), in particular, had employed a methodology for identifying state-created liberty interests that emphasized \"the language of a particular [prison] regulation\" instead of \"the nature of the deprivation.\" Sandin, 515 U.S., at 481, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  In Sandin, we criticized this methodology as creating a disincentive for States to promulgate procedures for prison management, and as involving the federal courts in the day-to-day management of prisons. Id., at 482-483, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  For these reasons, we abrogated the methodology of parsing the language of particular regulations. \"[T]he search for a negative implication from mandatory language in prisoner regulations has strayed from the real concerns undergirding the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.  The time has come to return to the due process principles we believe were correctly established in and applied in Wolff and Meachum. Following Wolff, we recognize that States may under certain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by the Due Process Clause.  But these interests will generally be limited to freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process  Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation  to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id., at 483-484, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 (citations and footnote omitted).\n\nAfter Sandin, it is clear that the touchstone of the inquiry into the existence of a protected, state-created liberty interest in avoiding restrictive conditions of confinement is not the language of regulations regarding those conditions but the nature of those conditions themselves \"in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id., at 484, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293. \n\nApplying this refined inquiry, Sandin found no liberty interest protecting against a 30-day assignment to segregated confinement because it did not \"present a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of [the inmate's] sentence.\" Id., at 485, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  We noted, for example, that inmates in the general population experienced \"significant amounts of 'lockdown time'\" and that the degree of confinement in disciplinary segregation was not excessive.  Id., at 486, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293 .  We did not find, moreover, the short duration of segregation to work a major disruption in the inmate's environment.  Ibid.\n\n The Sandin standard requires us to determine if assignment to OSP \"imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Id., at 484, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293.  In Sandin's wake the Courts of Appeals have not reached consistent conclusions for identifying the baseline from which to measure what is atypical and significant in any particular prison system. Compare e.g., Beverati v. Smith, 120 F.3d 500, 504 (CA4 1997), and Keenan v. Hall, 83 F.3d 1083, 1089 (CA9 1996), with Hatch v. District of Columbia, 337 U.S. App. D.C. 266, 184 F.3d 846, 847 (CADC 1999).  See also Wagner v. Hanks, 128 F.3d 1173, 1177 (CA7 1997).  This divergence indicates the difficulty of locating the appropriate baseline, an issue that was not explored at length in the briefs.  We need not resolve the issue here, however, for we are satisfied that assignment to OSP imposes an atypical and significant hardship under any plausible baseline. \n\nFor an inmate placed in OSP, almost all human contact is prohibited, even to the point that conversation is not permitted  from cell to cell; the light, though it may be dimmed, is on for 24 hours; exercise is for 1 hour per day, but only in a small indoor room.  Save perhaps for the especially severe limitations on all human contact, these conditions likely would apply to most solitary confinement facilities, but here there are two added components.  First is the duration.  Unlike the 30-day placement inSandin, placement at OSP is indefinite and, after an initial 30-day review,  is reviewed just annually.  Second is that placement disqualifies an otherwise eligible inmate for parole consideration. Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 728.  While any of these conditions standing alone might not be sufficient to create a liberty interest, taken together they impose an atypical and significant hardship within the correctional context.  It follows that respondents have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment to OSP.  Sandin, supra, at 483, 132 L. Ed. 2d 418, 115 S. Ct. 2293. \n\n OSP's harsh conditions may well be necessary and appropriate in light of the danger that high-risk inmates pose both to prison officials and to other prisoners.  See infra, 545 U.S. 209, 227, 125 S. Ct. 2384, 162 L. Ed. 2d, at 192-193.  That necessity, however, does not diminish our conclusion that the conditions give rise to a liberty interest in their avoidance. \n\nIV \n\n A liberty interest having been established, we turn to the question of what process is due an inmate whom Ohio seeks to place in OSP.  Because the requirements of due process are \"flexible and cal[l] for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands,\" Morrissey v. Brewer,408 U.S. 471, 481, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484, 92 S. Ct. 2593 (1972), we generally have declined to establish rigid rules and instead have embraced a framework to evaluate the sufficiency of particular procedures.  The framework, established in Mathews v. Eldridge,424 U.S. 319, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18, 96 S. Ct. 893 (1976), requires consideration of three distinct factors: \"First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation  of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\" Id., at 335, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18, 96 S. Ct. 893.\n\nThe Court of Appeals upheld the District Court's procedural modifications under the assumption that Sandin altered the first Mathews factor.  It reasoned that, \"[i]n this first factor, Sandin affects the due process balance: because only those conditions that constitute 'atypical and significant hardships' give rise to liberty interests, those interests will necessarily be of a weight requiring greater due process protection.\" 372 F.3d at 358-359.  This proposition does not follow from Sandin.  Sandin concerned only whether a state-created liberty interest existed so as to trigger Mathews balancing at all.  Having found no liberty interest to be at stake,Sandin had no occasion to consider whether the private interest was weighty vis-a-vis the remaining Mathews factors. \n\n Applying the three factors set forth inMathews, we find Ohio's New Policy provides a sufficient level of process.  We first consider the significance of the inmate's interest in avoiding erroneous placement at OSP.  Prisoners held in lawful confinement have their liberty curtailed by definition, so the procedural protections to which they are entitled are more limited than in cases where the right at stake is the right to be free from confinement at all.  See, e.g., Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 43 L. Ed. 2d 54, 95 S. Ct. 854 (1975); Wolff,418 U.S. 539, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963.  The private interest at stake here, while more than minimal, must be evaluated, nonetheless, within the context of the prison system and its attendant curtailment of liberties. \n\n The second factor addresses the risk of an erroneous placement under the procedures in place, and the probable value, if any, of additional or alternative procedural safeguards.  The New Policy provides that an inmate must receive notice  of the factual basis leading to consideration for OSP placement and a fair opportunity for rebuttal.  Our procedural due process cases have consistently observed that these are among the most important procedural mechanisms for purposes of avoiding erroneous deprivations.  See Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex,442 U.S. 1, 15, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100 (1979); Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill,470 U.S. 532, 543, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494, 105 S. Ct. 1487 (1985); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 80, 32 L. Ed. 2d 556, 92 S. Ct. 1983 (1972) (\"For more than a centurythe central meaning of procedural due process has been clear: 'Parties whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard; and in order that they may enjoy that right they must first be notified'\" (quoting Baldwin v. Hale, 68 U.S. 223, 1 Wall. 223, 233, 17 L. Ed. 531 (1864))).  Requiring officials to provide a brief summary of the factual basis for the classification review and allowing the inmate a rebuttal opportunity safeguards against the inmate's being mistaken for another or singled out for insufficient reason.  In addition to having the opportunity to be heard at the Classification Committee stage, Ohio also invites the inmate to submit objections prior to the final level of review.  This second opportunity further reduces the possibility of an erroneous deprivation. \n\nAlthough a subsequent reviewer may overturn an affirmative recommendation for OSP placement, the reverse is not true; if one reviewer declines to recommend OSP placement, the process terminates. This avoids one of problems apparently present under the Old Policy, where, even if two levels of reviewers recommended against placement, a later reviewer could overturn their recommendation without explanation. \n\nIf the recommendation is OSP placement, Ohio requires that the decisionmaker provide a short statement of reasons.  This requirement guards against arbitrary decisionmaking while also providing the inmate a basis for objection before the next decisionmaker or in a subsequent classification review.  The statement also serves as a guide for future behavior.  See Greenholtz, supra, at 16, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100. \n\n As we have noted, Ohio provides multiple levels of review for any decision recommending OSP placement, with power to overturn the recommendation at each level.  In addition to these safeguards, Ohio further reduces the risk of erroneous placement by providing for a placement review within 30 days of an inmate's initial assignment to OSP. \n\n The thirdMathews factor addresses the State's interest.  In the context of prison management, and in the specific circumstances of this case, this interest is a dominant consideration.  Ohio has responsibility for imprisoning nearly 44,000 inmates. Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 727.  The State's first obligation must be to ensure the safety of guards and prison personnel, the public, and the prisoners themselves.  See Hewitt, 459 U.S., at 473, 74 L. Ed. 675, 103 S. Ct. 864.\n\nPrison security, imperiled by the brutal reality of prison gangs, provides the backdrop of the State's interest.  Clandestine, organized, fueled by race-based hostility, and  committed to fear and violence as a means of disciplining their own members and their rivals, gangs seek nothing less than to control prison life and to extend their power outside prison walls.  See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 6.  Murder of an inmate, a guard, or one of their family members on the outside is a common form of gang discipline and control, as well as a condition for membership in some gangs. See, e.g., United States v. Santiago, 46 F.3d 885, 888 (CA9 1995); United States v. Silverstein, 732 F.2d 1338, 1341 (CA7 1984).  Testifying against, or otherwise informing on, gang activities can invite one's own death sentence. It is worth noting in this regard that for prison gang members serving life sentences, some without the possibility of parole, the deterrent effects of ordinary criminal punishment may be substantially diminished.  See id., at 1343 (\"[T]o many inmates of Marion's Control Unit [a federal Supermax facility,  ] the price of murder must not be high and to some it must be close to zero\"). \n\n The problem of scarce resources is another component of the State's interest.  The cost of keeping a single prisoner in one of Ohio's ordinary maximum-security prisons is $34,167 per year, and the cost to maintain each inmate at OSP is $49,007 per year.  See Austin I, supra, at 734, n. 17.  We can assume that Ohio, or any other penal system, faced with costs like these will find it difficult to fund more effective education and vocational assistance programs to improve the lives of the prisoners. It follows that courts must give substantial deference to prison management decisions before mandating additional expenditures for elaborate procedural safeguards when correctional officials conclude that a prisoner has engaged in disruptive behavior. \n\n The State's interest must be understood against this background.  Were Ohio to allow an inmate to call witnesses or provide other attributes of an adversary hearing before ordering transfer to OSP, both the State's immediate objective of controlling the prisoner and its greater objective of controlling the prison could be defeated.  This problem,  moreover, is not alleviated by providing an exemption for witnesses who pose a hazard, for nothing in the record indicates simple mechanisms exist to determine when witnesses may be called without fear of reprisal.  The danger to witnesses, and the difficulty in obtaining their cooperation, make the probable value of an adversary-type hearing doubtful in comparison to its obvious costs. \n\n A balance of theMathews factors yields the conclusion that Ohio's New Policy is adequate to safeguard an inmate's liberty interest in not being assigned to OSP.  Ohio is not, for example, attempting to remove an inmate from free society for a specific parole violation, see, e.g., Morrissey,408 U.S., at 481, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484, 92 S. Ct. 2593, or to revoke good time credits for specific, serious misbehavior, see, e.g., Wolff, 418 U.S., at 539, 41 L. Ed. 2d 935, 94 S. Ct. 2963, where more formal, adversary-type procedures might be useful.  Where the inquiry draws more on the experience of prison administrators, and where the State's interest implicates the  safety of other inmates and prison personnel, the informal, nonadversary procedures set forth in Greenholtz, 442 U.S. 1, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100, and Hewitt v. Helms,supra, provide the appropriate model.  Greenholtz, supra, at 16, 60 L. Ed. 2d 668, 99 S. Ct. 2100 (level of process due for inmates being considered for release on parole includes opportunity to be heard and notice of any adverse decision); Hewitt, supra, at 473-476, 74 L. Ed. 2d 675, 103 S. Ct. 864 (level of process due for inmates being considered for transfer to administrative segregation includes some notice of charges and an opportunity to be heard).  Although Sandin abrogated Greenholtz's and Hewitt's methodology for establishing the liberty interest, these cases remain instructive for their discussion of the appropriate level of procedural safeguards. Ohio's New Policy provides informal, nonadversary procedures comparable to those we upheld in Greenholtz and Hewitt, and no further procedural modifications are necessary in order to satisfy due process under the Mathews test.  Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals should have ordered the New Policy altered. \n\nThe effect of the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, in particular 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A), in this case has not been discussed at any length in the briefs.  In view of our disposition it is unnecessary to address its application here. \n\nProlonged confinement in Supermax may be the State's only option for the control of some inmates, and claims alleging violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments were resolved, or withdrawn, by settlement in an early phase of this case.  Here, any claim of excessive punishment in individual circumstances is not before us. \n\nThe complaint challenged OSP assignments under the Old Policy, and the unwritten policies that preceded it, and alleged injuries resulting from those systems. Ohio conceded that assignments made under the Old Policy were, to say the least, imprecise.  The District Court found constitutional violations had arisen under those earlier versions, and held  that the New Policy would produce many of the same constitutional problems.  Austin I, 189 F. Supp. 2d, at 749-754.  We now hold that the New Policy as described in this opinion strikes a constitutionally permissible balance between the factors of the Mathews framework.  If an inmate were to demonstrate that the New Policy did not in practice operate in this fashion, resulting in a cognizable injury, that could be the subject of an appropriate future challenge.  On remand, the Court of Appeals, or the District Court, may consider in the first instance what, if any, prospective relief is still a necessary and appropriate remedy for due process violations under Ohio's previous policies.  Any such relief must, of course, satisfy the conditions set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(A). * * * \n\n The Court of Appeals was correct to find the inmates possess a liberty interest in avoiding assignment at OSP.  The Court of Appeals was incorrect, however, to sustain the procedural modifications ordered by the District Court.  The portion of the Court of Appeals' opinion reversing the District Court's substantive modifications was not the subject of review upon certiorari and is unaltered by our decision. \n\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \n\nIt is so ordered.  \n\n"
